## License Determination

The license for a particular work is defined with following prioritized rules:

1.  License information directly present in the file
1.  `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file in the same directory as the work
1.  First `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file found when exploring parent directories up to the project top level directory
1.  **On the `main` branch only:** otherwise defaults to dual-release under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0, at your option
