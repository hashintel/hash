- the [GNU Affero General Public License 3.0](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-AGPL.md); or
- the [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-ELASTIC.md).

Written content, illustrations and graphics published under the `apps/hashdotai`, `apps/hashdotdesign`, and `apps/hashdotdev` directories are made available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-CC.md) license.

## License Determination

The license for a particular work is defined with following prioritized rules:

1.  License information directly present in the file
1.  `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file in the same directory as the work
1.  First `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file found when exploring parent directories up to the project top level directory
1.  **On the `main` branch only:** otherwise defaults to dual-release under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0, at your option

## Quick Reference

As outlined by the license files in the respective directories:

- Within `/blocks` source code is (unless otherwise noted) generally available under either the MIT License or Apache License 2.0, at your option.
- Within `/apps`, `/libs` and `/tests`, source code in sub-directories (including those which are nested) named `@local` or prefixed `hash` are typically licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
- Within `/apps/engine` source code is licensed under the Elastic License 2.0, unless otherwise noted.

These **quick reference** guidelines are provided as general heuristics only. In all cases, you should follow the above **license determination** rules, outlined in the section above, to verify the actual terms under which code has been published.
