# HASH

This is HASH's _public monorepo_ which contains our public code, docs, and other key resources.

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_what-is-hash_20px-base.svg)][gh-what-is-hash] &nbsp; What is HASH?

**HASH is a self-buliding, open-source database which grows, structures and checks itself.** With it, we're creating a platform for decision-making, which helps you integrate, understand and use data in a variety of different ways. [Read our blog post →](https://hash.ai/blog/self-building-database)
