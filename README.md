# HASH

This is HASH's _public monorepo_ which contains our public code, docs, and other key resources.

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_what-is-hash_20px-base.svg)][gh-what-is-hash] &nbsp; What is HASH?

**HASH is a platform for decision-making, which helps you integrate, understand and use data in a variety of different ways.**

HASH does this by combining various different powerful tools together into one simple interface. These range from data pipelines and a graph database, through to an all-in-one workspace, no-code tool builder, and agent-based simulation engine.

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_getting-started_20px-base.svg)][gh-getting-started] &nbsp; Getting started

- 🚀 &nbsp; **Quick-start (<5 mins):** try the full hosted platform at [hash.ai], ready to go in seconds
- 🤖 &nbsp; **Self-hosting:** check out our developer site at [hash.dev] for a guide to running your own instance of HASH
