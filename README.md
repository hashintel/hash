# HASH

This is HASH's _public monorepo_ which contains our public code, docs, and other key resources.

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_what-is-hash_20px-base.svg)][gh-what-is-hash] &nbsp; What is HASH?

**HASH is a platform for decision-making, which helps you integrate, understand and use data in a variety of different ways.**

HASH does this by combining various different powerful tools together into one simple interface. These range from data pipelines and a graph database, through to an all-in-one workspace, no-code tool builder, and agent-based simulation engine. These exist at varying stages of maturity, and while some are polished, not all are ready for real-world production use. You can read more about out big-picture vision at [hash.dev]

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_getting-started_20px-base.svg)][gh-getting-started] &nbsp; Getting started

- ðŸš€ &nbsp; **Quick-start (<5 mins):** try the full hosted platform at [hash.ai], ready to go in seconds
- ðŸ¤– &nbsp; **Self-hosting:** check out our developer site at [hash.dev] for a guide to running your own instance of HASH

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_examples_20px-base.svg)][gh-examples] &nbsp; Examples

**Coming soon:** we'll be collecting examples in the _[Awesome HASH]_ repository.

### Top-level layout

This repository's contents is divided across several primary sections:

- [**`/apps`**](/apps) contains the primary code powering our runnable [applications](#applications)
- [**`/blocks`**](/blocks) contains our public _Block Protocol_ [blocks](#blocks)
- [**`/infra`**](/infra) houses deployment scripts, utilities and other [infrastructure](#infrastructure) useful in running our apps
- [**`/libs`**](/libs) contains [libraries](#libraries) including npm packages and Rust crates
- [**`/tests`**](/tests) contains end-to-end and integration tests that span across one or more apps, blocks or libs

Key projects within are summarized below.

### Applications

- [`hash`](apps/hash): entry-point for **[HASH]**, our data-driven, all-in-one AI workspace
- [`engine`](apps/engine): experimental version of **[HASH Engine]**, a versatile agent-based simulation engine written in Rust

### Blocks

- Various directories containing the source code for all of HASH's open-source [Block Protocol] (**Ãž**) blocks, summarized in a [handy table](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/blocks#blocks). Please note: this table/directory contains HASH-published blocks only, and does not contain the full extent of available Ãž blocks.

### Infrastructure

- [`docker`](infra/docker): Docker assets relating to HASH
- [`terraform`](infra/terraform): Terraform modules for deploying HASH on AWS

### Libraries

#### Rust crates

- [`antsi`](libs/antsi): Rust crate supporting Select Graphic Rendition (as defined in ISO 6429) without external dependencies
- [`deer`](libs/deer): fail-slow deserialization framework for Rust, featuring meaningful error messages and context
- [`error-stack`](libs/error-stack): context-aware error-handling library for Rust which supports attaching arbitrary user data
- [`sarif`](libs/sarif): representation of the SARIF specification in Rust

#### npm packages

- [`@hashintel/block-design-system`](libs/@hashintel/block-design-system): a relatively unopinionated design system for [Block Protocol] blocks
- [`@hashintel/design-system`](libs/@hashintel/design-system): the design system for [HASH] and our [hash.ai] website
- [`@hashintel/query-editor`](libs/@hashintel/query-editor): editing interface for [HASH Graph] queries
- [`@hashintel/type-editor`](libs/@hashintel/type-editor): editing interface for [Block Protocol types]
