# HASH

This is HASH's _public monorepo_ which contains our public code, docs, and other key resources.

## [![a](/.github/assets/gh_icon_what-is-hash_20px-base.svg)][gh-what-is-hash] &nbsp; What is HASH?

**HASH is a platform for decision-making, which helps you integrate, understand and use data in a variety of different ways.**

HASH does this by combining various different powerful tools together into one simple interface. These range from data pipelines and a graph database, through to an all-in-one workspace, no-code tool builder, and agent-based simulation engine. These exist at varying stages of maturity, and while some are polished, not all are ready for real-world production use. You can read more about out big-picture vision at [hash.dev]
