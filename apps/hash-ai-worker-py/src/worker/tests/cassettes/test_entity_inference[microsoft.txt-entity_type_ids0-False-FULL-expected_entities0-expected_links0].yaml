      an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington.
      Microsoft''s best-known software products are the Windows line of operating
      systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge
      web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles
      and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft
      ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States
      corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world''s largest software maker
      by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information
      technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon,
      Apple, and Meta Platforms.\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen
      on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.
      It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS
      in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company''s 1986 initial public offering
      (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and
      an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s,
      it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made
      several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn

      an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington.
      Microsoft''s best-known software products are the Windows line of operating
      systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge
      web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles
      and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft
      ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States
      corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world''s largest software maker
      by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information
      technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon,
      Apple, and Meta Platforms.\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen
      on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.
      It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS
      in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company''s 1986 initial public offering
      (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and
      an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s,
      it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made
      several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn
      for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[3] followed by its acquisition of Skype
      Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[4]\n\nAs of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant
      in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite
      market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market
      to Android.[5] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and
      enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including
      Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed
      reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual
      Studio).\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned
      a \"devices and services\" strategy.[6] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring
      Danger Inc. in 2008,[7] entering the personal computer production market for
      the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of
      tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition
      of Nokia''s devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as
      CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on
      cloud computing, a move that helped the company''s shares reach their highest
      value since December 1999.[8][9]\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018,
      Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company
      in the world.[10] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market
      cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion
      after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2022, Microsoft has the fourth-highest
      global brand valuation.\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic
      practices and the company''s software has been criticized for problems with
      ease of use, robustness, and security."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null,
