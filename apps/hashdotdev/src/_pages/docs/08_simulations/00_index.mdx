description: Getting started with simulations in HASH
---

[HASH](/) was designed as an end-to-end solution for quickly creating massive, rich, real-time simulations.

<Hint style="warning">

We're still working on support for simulations in HASH. The docs in this section refer to building agent-based models that run in hEngine and hCore, standalone tools we've released (for use by developers) which exist independently of the main HASH application.

</Hint>

You can use HASH's simulation tools to build rich, detailed, agent-based simulations of [factory floors](/@hash/warehouse-conveyor1), [business processes](/@hash/interconnected-call-center), [public policy decisions](/@b/sir-infection-network-w-rapid-tests), or any other type of complex system you can imagine.

Our simulation docs are split into:

- Create
- Discover
- Run

## Future Plans

Functionality various 'views' (geospatial/3D, charting/plotting)
Entities in webs can be easily accessed via the HASH API, and instantiated directly in simulations without data processing.

## Getting Started

As a new user, the best way to learn more about agent-based modeling is to [read up on the basics](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/agent-based-modeling-basics-1), and try your hand at the [simulation tutorials](/docs/simulation/tutorials/hello-hash). You can also browse our public registry of [pre-built HASH models](/models?sort=popularity&query=%40hash) to find ones with interesting dynamics that you can freely use and adapt for your own needs.

If you've used other simulation modeling software before, you might find that models built in HASH are a little different to those you're used to seeing.

HASH leverages composable [agents](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/), [behaviors](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/behaviors/) and types to make it fast and easy to create realistic, well-calibrated simulations.

## Simulation Engine

**hEngine** is HASH's simulation engine. In the future we plan to integrate this directly into the main HASH application. For now, an experimental version of it is available to use independently.

## Simulation IDE

**hCore** is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for building agent-based models and running simulations. It provides a temporary graphical user interface for working with simulations until such time as they are natively supported within HASH itself. hCore will ultimately be deprecated, and is no longer officially maintained.

## Getting Help
