subtitle: "The agent-based simulation engine powering HASH"
---

hEngine is a simulation engine written in Rust. It provides a headless, command-line accessible environment for executing agent-based simulations. In the future we plan to integrate this directly into the main HASH application. For now, an experimental version of it is available to use independently. However, this is neither stable nor at feature parity with [**hCore**](/docs/simulations/ide).

_We'll be documenting hEngine comprehensively here soon._
