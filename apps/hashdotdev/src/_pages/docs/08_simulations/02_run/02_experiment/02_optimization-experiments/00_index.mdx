description: "How to use HASH to optimize your simulation's parameters"
---

Often, when running an experiment, you don't necessarily want to see every simulation's outcomes, you want to find the best ones, the parameters that **optimize** a desired metric. With HASH's optimization engine, you can automatically generate simulations and find the set of parameters that will maximize or minimize a metric.

</Hint>

## Creating Optimization Experiments

To create an optimization experiment, first create the metric that represents the value you want to optimize.

<Hint style="info">
  [Read more on defining
  metrics](/docs/simulations/run/simulation/outputs/analysis/metrics).
</Hint>

For example, in [Sugarscape](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/sugarscape/stable), you might be interested in what parameters will optimize the average sugar of cells. In that case you can use the existing metric:

Now use the experiment wizard to create a new experiment and fill in the options:

- Select `optimization` as the type.
- Use the metric name you previously defined as the metric.
- Decide whether to `maximize` or `minimize` the objective.
- Select the fields \([globals](/docs/simulations/create/configuration)\) that will be varied and define their constraints.

### Specifying Constraints

For each field being varied, you must specify the valid values \(constraints\) for the optimization experiment. You can specify discrete values with a comma separated list, with or without spaces:

- `true, false`
- `1,2,3`
- `"one", "two"`

You can also specify ranges of values using `-` for fields which accept `numbers`.

- `1-3`
- `-3-0`
- `-10 - -3`

### Running an Optimization

You can choose to run your experiment in hCloud directly upon creating it, or save your experiment to be run later from the **Experiments** dropdown in the menubar.

<Hint style="warning">
  To run a simulation in hCloud, you must first set the [Behavior
  Keys](/docs/simulations/create/behaviors/behavior-keys) of your simulations
  behaviors.
</Hint>

While the optimization experiment is running, individual runs will populate the experiment queue in the activity sidebar. Hover over a run to see the metrics value and the parameters for that particular run.

When the optimization run completes, the best run - the run where the parameters maximized or minimized the metric - will be highlighted.
