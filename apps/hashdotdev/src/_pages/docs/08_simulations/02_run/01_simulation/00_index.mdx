title: "Single Runs"
---

## Introduction

While building simulation models can be instructive and informative, forcing you to make unstated assumptions explicit, and reflect on the behavioral logic of agents in a system, actually _running_ a simulation can provide a vast amount more insight into a system.

Executing a simulation once, or performing a "single run" may be useful when:

- you're developing a simulation, and you want to sense-check its behavior, or its ability to run;
- you want to quickly see the impact of a specific behavior or parameter change;
- you want to inspect a simulation's logic or visuals, or a demo of the same.

## Running Simulations

### hCore

1. Load a simulation into hCore.
1. Initiate a single-run simulation by clicking the "Run" button (the 'running man' icon).

### hEngine
