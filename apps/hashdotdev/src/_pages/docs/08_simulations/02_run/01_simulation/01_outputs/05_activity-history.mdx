title: "Activity History"

When you make changes to files in a project, create a release, or run a simulation/experiment, HASH automatically records the action and output within the _Activity_ panel \(by default the right-hand sidebar in hCore\). You can revisit earlier versions of a project, view previously computed results, or re-run a simulation or experiment with its original values in order to reproduce the run.

You can also filter within the activity panel to show only events matching a specific type.
