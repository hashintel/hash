title: "Creating Simulations"
---

You can create a new simulation by forking an existing one, or by creating a simulation project from scratch.

Creating your own simulations using our current tools (hCore and hEngine) requires a working knowledge of at least one of JavaScript, Python, or Rust. These are the programming languages that HASH simulation models can currently be written in. In the future, we'll be making HASH simulations more accessible to users who don't know how to code.

To learn more about creating your own simulations, read on.
