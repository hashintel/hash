## Agent-Based Modeling

Agent-based modeling \(ABM\) is a powerful way to simulate scenarios with complex deterministic behavior.

In contrast with traditional simulation and modeling, agent-based modelers describe the behavior of _individual agents,_ rather than using formulas to describe the behavior or dynamics of the system as a whole. This allows for complex interactions to emerge from basic rules. In HASH, we call these rules _behaviors._

## Example Simulation

A well-known example of an agent-based simulation is Conway's _Game of Life_ - a simulation performed on a grid, where each cell can be either alive or dead. Here, the cells are _agents_, and the rules are _behaviors._ The behaviors for Conway's _Game of Life_ are as follows:

> 1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
> 1. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
> 1. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

These simple interactions produce what is called _emergent behavior_, where simple rules create complex results.

_Game of Life_ enthusiasts have spent years exploring the search space of the model and its possible creations.

Try playing with the _Game of Life_ HASH model and modifying its initial state \(contained in the `create_gol_grid.js` file\). Some arrangements of agents produce arrangements of agents known as "spaceships" that move across the grid as a group and can even generate new groups of agents.
