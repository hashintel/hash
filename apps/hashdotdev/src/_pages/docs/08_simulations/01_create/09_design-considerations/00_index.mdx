This section covers:

- The [actor model](/docs/simulations/create/design-considerations/actor-model) at the heart of HASH
- How to handle agents [competing for resources](/docs/simulations/create/design-considerations/resource-access)
- How to design for [varying timescales](/docs/simulations/create/design-considerations/timescales)
- Utilizing [probability distributions](/docs/simulations/create/design-considerations/distributions) within your simulations
- [Verifying and validating](/docs/simulations/create/design-considerations/verify-validate) simulations
