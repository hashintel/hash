title: "Getting the Behavior Index"
---

Sometimes behaviors may need to know which behaviors executed before it, and which behaviors will execute after it, in the agent's behavior chain. For this, the agent's `state` has a special method — `state.behaviorIndex()` in Javascript and `state.behavior_index()` in Python — which returns the index of the currently executing behavior in the agent's behavior chain.

```javascript
const behavior = (state, context) => {
  const index = state.behaviorIndex();
  console.log("behavior index =", index);
  console.log("behavior name =", state.behaviors[index]);
};
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Python" >

```python
def behavior(state, context):
    index = state.behavior_index()
    print("behavior index =", index)
    print("behavior name =", state.behaviors[index])
```

You can see an example use of this method in the Wildfires simulation. When a tree burns down, or begins to regrow, it cycles through three behaviors: `tree.js`, `fire.js` and `ember.js`.

The switching is accomplished by indexing into the agent's behavior array using `state.behaviorIndex()` and assigning the next behavior.

```javascript
// fire.js

function behavior(state, context) {
  // Replace the fire behavior with the ember behavior
  state.behaviors[state.behaviorIndex()] = "ember.js";

  state.color = context.globals().fireColor;
  state.shape = "fire";
  state.height = 3;
}
```
