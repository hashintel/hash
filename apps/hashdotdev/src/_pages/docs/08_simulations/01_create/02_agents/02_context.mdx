title: "Context"
---

Besides their [**state**](/docs/simulations/create/agents/state), an agent always has access to their **context**. The context is the parts of the simulation that the agent is exposed to; another way of thinking about it is that an agent's context are the parts of the simulation that the agent "can see".

The `context` object is passed to each behavior, and it has the following methods:

- `neighbors`
- `messages`
- `globals`
- `data`
- `step`

All values accessed through `context` are _read-only_, and if modified, will not directly change the state of the simulation or any other agent.

## Neighbors

The `context.neighbors()` method returns a collection of the agent's neighbors. The agent must have a `"position"` field defined, and either its own `"search_radius"` field or `globals.json` must have `"search_radius"` defined in the [topology](/docs/simulations/create/configuration/topology/).

  for (neighbor of context.neighbors()) {
    pos = neighbor.position;
    // ...
  }
};

        pos = neighbor["position"]

<Hint style="info">
  An agent can read the state of its neighbors, but agents cannot directly
  modify another agent's state. However, agents may communicate by [sending
  messages](/docs/simulations/create/agent-messages/sending-messages) to each
  other.
</Hint>

Neighbors are calculated at the beginning of every time step, for every agent that has a `search_radius` value. For best performance, only assign a `search_radius` to an agent that needs to call context.neighbors\(\).

## Messages

The `context.messages()` method returns a collection of messages received by the agent in this step of the simulation. For more details see [Handling Messages](/docs/simulations/create/agent-messages/handling-messages).

## Globals

The `context.globals()` method returns an immutable JSON object of the simulation's constants, as defined in `globals.json`. For more details see [Globals](/docs/simulations/create/configuration/).

## Data

The `context.data()` method returns an immutable JSON object of the simulation's datasets that have been added through the "Add to Simulation" toolbar. For more details see [Datasets](/docs/simulations/create/datasets/).

## Step

The `context.step()` method returns the current step number of the simulation. Simulation steps start at the number 1.
