## Geometric Shapes

HASH allows you to visualize agents with various geometric shapes. Any of the following shapes are valid keyword strings for an agent's `shape` field:

- box
- cone
- cylinder
- dodecahedron
- flatplane
- icosahedron
- octahedron
- sphere
- tetrahedron
- torus
- torusknot

## 3D Models

HASH also allows you to use 3D mesh models. Use any of these keyword strings in an agent's `shape` field. You can use the agent's `scale` and `direction` property to visualize the agent to your taste.
