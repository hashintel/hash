The HASH [Physics Library](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/physics) contains behaviors to help you create simulated physics environments. They are written in Rust, which means they are optimized to run in the HASH Engine.

## Behaviors

### Forces

_@hash/physics/forces.rs_

This behavior is responsible for translating forces on an agent into changes in velocity, and changing the agent's position based on the velocity. It makes use of semi-implicit Euler integration to determine changes in position and velocity. The behavior references `state.force` to determine changes in velocity, and clears it after each step, so it should be placed towards the end of an agent's behavior chain.

Agents using this behavior must have a `mass`, `position`, and `velocity`field. The agent or **globals.json** must have a `dt` field which determines the time step for the integration. If your physics simulation does not appear to be behaving properly, you likely need to reduce the value for `dt`. It is recommend to use values between 0.1 and 0.01.

### Gravity

_@hash/physics/gravity.rs_

This behavior adds to the agent's `force` field in the negative z direction, representing the force of gravity. If the agent or **globals.json** does not specify a `gravity` field, then it will assume a default value of 9.81 \(the force of gravity on Earth in meters/second\).

### Spring

_@hash/physics/spring.rs_

This behavior simulates a spring connected between the agent and one of its neighbors. It adds a force to the agent's `force` field proportional to it's distance from a certain neighbor, based on the base length of the spring, the spring constant, and the amount of damping. To run this behavior, the agent must have a `springs` field, which contains an array of objects defined like so:

```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "behaviors": ["@hash/physics/spring.rs", "@hash/physics/forces.rs"],
  "springs": [
    {
      "agent_id": string, // The agent_id of the connected agent
      "length": number, // The neutral length of the spring
      "k": number, // The spring constant
      "damping": number, // OPTIONAL The damping constant B
    },
    "..."
  ]
}
```

The spring force is calculated according to Hooke's Law: _F = -kx - Bv._

<Hint style="warning">
  If the agent referenced in a spring definition is outside of the
  `search_radius`, then it will be ignored since it cannot find the position of
  that agent.
</Hint>

### Collision

_@hash/physics/collision.rs_

This behavior controls collisions between agents who come too close to one another. It calculates a purely elastic collision between the agents. Agents running this behavior must have a `mass`, `position`, and `velocity` field specified. If an agent **A** collides with an agent **B** which is **not** running the collision behavior, **A** will assume that **B** is **immovable \(has an infinite mass\).**

<Hint style="warning">
  Agents must have a `search_radius` of &gt;= 1 specified to ensure they see
  other agents.
