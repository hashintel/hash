## `neighborsOnPosition(agentA, neighbors)`

This function returns all neighbors that share the same position as `agentA`. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

## `neighborsInRadius(agentA, neighbors, max_radius, min_radius, z_axis)`

This function returns all neighbors within the specified radii. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well. By default the max and min radii are \[1, 0\]. `z_axis` is false by default, but by passing true you can enable search in a spherical, as opposed to circular radius.

## `neighborsInFront(agentA, neighbors, colinear)`

This function returns all neighbors located in front of an agent. `agentA` must have a "direction" property since "in front" is determined by the plane perpendicular to that vector. `colinear` defaults to false, but by passing true the function will only return agents on the same _line_ as the "direction". The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

## `neighborsBehind(agentA, neighbors, colinear)`

This function returns all neighbors located behind the agent. It functions identically to **neighborsInFront** but returns agents behind the plane of `agentA`. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

  // Check if my neighbor is being tailed
  const neighborTail = hstd.neighborsBehind(neighbors[0], neighbors, true);
