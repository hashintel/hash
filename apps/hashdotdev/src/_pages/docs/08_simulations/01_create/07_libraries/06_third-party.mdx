## Third-Party Behaviors

Simulation behaviors developed by other users can be [found on hIndex](https://simulation.hash.ai/behaviors).

## Third-Party Packages

### hEngine

hEngine can be used in conjunction with any third-party library or code via your normal package manager. Care should be taken to avoid weakening simulation reproducibility guarantees while using third-party packages.

### hCore

hCore does not support importing third-party JavaScript packages or Rust crates, but does, however, provide limited support for a subset of Python libraries. We run Python3 in the browser through [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) and [currently support all of the packages that Pyodide does](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages).

**The packages below have proven particularly popular with modelers using HASH:**
