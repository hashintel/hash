title: "Adding Data to a Process Model"
---

You can use your real world business data to power your process model and create a digital twin of your business process.

## Loading Data

<Hint style="info">
  For more on using data in HASH, see
  [Datasets](/docs/simulations/create/datasets/)
</Hint>

HASH supports CSV and JSON datasets. Upload your dataset by clicking the 'new dataset' option in the editor _(in the top left of the screen, over the file picker)_ or by finding/reusing an existing dataset from the HASH index and adding it to the simulation.

The dataset is stored in the 'data/' folder, and the data will be available in the simulation through context.data\(\)

```javascript
const behavior = (state, context) => {
  let cs = context.data()["CustomerServiceEmployeesSheet1.csv"];
};
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Python" >

```python
def behavior(state, context):
  cs = context.data()["CustomerServiceEmployeesSheet1.csv"]
```

## Customizing Parameters

With the data loaded in the simulation we can use it to power the process model. There are many different ways to use data + process models, but the most common are:

- Set the properties of the process model. For example, if a pizza delivery service model has a certain number of drivers available to deliver pizzas, they could use a dataset to set that number.
- Create distributions for modeling uncertainty. Now, if the pizza delivery service wants to estimate the number of orders they'll get in a day, they could take a dataset that captures last weeks orders of pizzas, choose a distribution that accurately models the data, and then use that to simulate new orders.

  Distributions.](/docs/simulations/concepts/designing-with-distributions)

## Example: Customer Service Data

A common business process simulation is the ticket support queue. Tickets from users come in and arrive in a queue. An available customer service agent takes a ticket, solves it, and then picks up the next ticket.

This process would have three elements:

- At the beginning, a **source** block that generates tickets
- At the end, a **sink** block that collects finished tickets
- In the middle, a **service** block where customer service workers take tickets and work on them. When a CS employee is working a ticket, they can't take a different ticket until they finish.

<Hint style="info">
  For more on the different blocks and when to use a given block, see [Process
  Model
  Concepts](/docs/simulations/concepts/designing-with-process-models/process-model-concepts)
</Hint>

Using the Process Model Builder, we can set properties for each of the blocks and update my simulation with it. The resulting code will look like:

```javascript
const agent = {
  agent_name: "process_model",
  behaviors: [
    "@hash/age/age.rs",
    "@hash/process/source.js",
    "@hash/process/service.js",
    "@hash/process/sink.js",
  ],
  process_labels: ["", "start", "work_on_tickets", "solved_tickets"],
  process_parameters: {
    start: {
      template: {},
      frequency: 1,
      rate: null,
      next_block: "work_on_tickets",
    },
    work_on_tickets: {
      time: 1,
      resource: "cs_employees",
      next_block: "solved_tickets",
    },
    solved_tickets: {},
  },
  position: [0, 0, 0],
};
```

Now we can take a [dataset defining different customer service employees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFSnjdBqbovplPwWo7DI77AX8rXWOmVQi1dW8c0l1-k/edit?usp=sharing), download it as a CSV, load it into the simulation, and use the data to set the number of CS employees we have on hand.

```javascript
// create_process.js

 "start": {
        "template": {},
        "frequency": 1,
        "rate": null,
        "next_block": "work_on_tickets"
      },
      "work_on_tickets": {
        "time": 1,
        "resource": "cs_employees",
        "next_block": "solved_tickets"
      },
      "solved_tickets": {}
    },
    //added a line for the cs_employees resource
  "cs_employees": context.data()["ExampleCustomerServiceEmployeesSheet1.csv"].length
}
```

This is a good start, but to make the model more realistic we can add a dataset representing ticket volumes over the past five days. I'll take the mean and standard deviation of the data, and set a triangular distribution for the number of tickets to generate every time step.

```javascript
// create_process.js

const { triangular } = hstd.stats;
let tickets = context.data()["Tickets.csv"];
//Get min and max number of tickets received per day
let min = tickets.reduce(
  (min, t) => (t.count < min ? t.count : min),
  data[0].count,
);
let max = tickets.reduce(
  (max, t) => (t.count > max ? t.count : max),
  data[0].count,
);
//Get the mode of the array and average with min and max to find the peak
let peak = (min + max + mode(tickets)) / 3;
```

```json
// in the process parameters ...
{
 "process_parameters": {
      "start": {
        "template": {},
        "frequency": 1,
        "rate": triangular.sample(min, max, peak),
        "next_block": "work_on_tickets"
      },
      "work_on_tickets": {
        "time": 1,
        "resource": "cs_employees",
        "next_block": "solved_tickets"
      },
      "solved_tickets": {}
    }
}
```

Now when we we run the simulation, we have a good estimate of what my customer service process will look like using real world data.
