title: "Sending Messages"

## Message Structure

Agents send messages by adding JSON objects to their `messages` array. The object is defined as:

```javascript
{
    to: "string" || "string"[]// an agent_id or agent_name
    type: "string" // a string that defines the type of the message
    data: "any" // an object that serves as the payload
}
```

- **to:** An agent id or an agent name. The agent with the corresponding `agent_id` field or the agent\(s\) with the corresponding `agent_name` field will receive the message in the next time step. If you want to send a message to multiple agents -- multicasting -- you can do so in one of two ways:
  - The "to" field of a message is an array, so you can include multiple agent names and IDs.
  - When sending a message to an `agent_name` that is shared by multiple agents, they will all receive the message. For instance, if five agents have the field `agent_name` set to `"forklift"`, they will all receive a message defined with `to: "forklift"`
- **type:** A user-defined string that serves as metadata for the object, describing the message and/or its purpose.
- **data:** A user-defined object that can contain any arbitrary data.

  We provide helper functions on the state object for adding messages.
  state.addMessage\(\) and state.add_message\(\), for JavaScript and Python,
  respectively.
