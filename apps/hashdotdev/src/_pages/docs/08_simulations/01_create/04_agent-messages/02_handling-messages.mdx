title: "Handling Messages"
---

**What happens when an agent receives a message?**

The Context passed to every agent provides a list of messages in the agent's inbox accessible via the `context.messages()` function. Here we can iterate through the list of messages sent to the agent and use that information to make decisions or change state. Note that the `to` field has been replaced by `from`.

```javascript
context {
    messages(): [
        {
            "from": "string" // uuid of agent who sent the message
            "type": "string" // describing contents or purpose
            "data": "any" // additional data contained in the message
        }
    ],
}
```

It's best to think of the `messages` field like a mailbox.

- When **sending** a message, we put the message in the outbox under the `messages` field on **state**.
- When **receiving** a message, it will show up in our inbox, under the `messages` field on **context**.

Notice the distinction. Context is immutable and any accidental changes made to it will not propagate.

<Hint style="info">
  Send messages by adding them to the `state.messages` array and access incoming
  ones through `context.messages()`.
</Hint>

Handling the messages here would be pretty simple - just iterating through the messages array in context.

    for (const message of context.messages()) {
        ...

    // OR

    context.messages().forEach(m => {
        ...
    })
}

}
```

The messages that an agent receives are only available on the timestep they received them. `context.messages()` is cleared between timesteps, so an agent will need to store the messages on their state if they want to preserve a message.
