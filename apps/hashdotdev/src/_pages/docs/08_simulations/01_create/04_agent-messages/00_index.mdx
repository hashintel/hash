title: "Messages"
---

Information in a simulation can propagate in one of two ways - either through neighbors, which we cover in [Behaviors](/docs/simulations/create/behaviors/) and [Topology](/docs/simulations/create/configuration/topology/), or through message passing.

Messages are a simple yet powerful way of moving data around a simulation and can be used to add, remove, and collect data from agents that are not necessarily near each other.

Agents send messages by adding them to the `state.messages` array, and they receive them by accessing `context.messages().`

Agents can create a message to send to either another agent or the simulation engine itself. Here, we send a message to an agent with an `agent_name` of "schelling":

```javascript
const behavior = (state, context) => {
  state.messages.push({
    to: "schelling",
    type: "data_point",
    data: {
      num_agents: 50,
    },
  });
};
```

```python
def behavior(state, context):
  state['messages'].append({
    "to": "schelling",
    "type": "data_point",
    "data": {
      "num_agents": 50
    }
  })

  If you want to jump right into code you can take a look at our [Message
  Passing Colors](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/message-passing-colors)
  simulation, which demos message passing among many agents.
</Hint>

You'll notice that each message is comprised of three fields: "to", "type", and "data."

- `to`: the `agent_name` or `agent_id` of the agent that the message will be delivered to (this can also be an array of agents)
- `type`: the type of message being sent, to help the message handler select the correct course of action
- `data`: any data you want to send along with the message

<Hint style="info">
  You can use the helper function state.addMessage\(to&lt;String&gt;,
  type&lt;String&gt;, data&lt;Dict&gt;\) to add messages directly to the
  state.messages field (the helper function can only take one agent as a "to"
  argument).

```python

  state.add_message("foo", "bar", {"msg": "hello"})

Messages are produced during a step, but are not delivered and processed until the next step.
