Organizations exist in HASH to allow you to create private spaces with other users for permissioned sharing and collaboration on projects. They are free to create, and can contain unlimited number of members.

## Create an organization

To create a new organization, view which organizations you are a member of, or modify your role in any organization you are currently attached to, navigate to your [HASH &gt; Account &gt; Orgs](/account/orgs) page.

## Join an existing organization

If you feel you should be a member of an organization that already exists in HASH, please contact that organization's admin. If you cannot identify the admin, [contact HASH](https://hash.ai/contact) for support.

## Leave an organization

You can leave an organization at any time by clicking the 'Leave' button on your [HASH &gt; Account &gt; Orgs](/account/orgs) dashboard.

## Request admin permissions

If you are a member of an organization without administrative permissions over that org, please contact an existing admin to request access.
