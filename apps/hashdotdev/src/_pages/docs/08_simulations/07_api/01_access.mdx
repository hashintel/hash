## Legacy APIs

Information regarding HASH's three legacy simulation APIs can be fonud below.

### hCore API

The **hCore API** (still available to use with [**hCore**](/docs/simulations/ide)) provides read and write access to the code and contents of simulation projects. This access can be used, amongst other things, to change the logic of a simulation based on external changes offline or in response to user-input outside of HASH. This unlocks the creation of domain-specific and custom user interfaces for building HASH models.

### hCloud API

The **hCloud API** provided access to the results of simulation and experiment runs executed on hCloud. This enabled HASH simulations to be integrated into production decision-making or Machine Learning workflows. _hCloud is no longer available for use by new users, pending integration of simulations into the core HASH application._

### hIndex API

The **hIndex API** enabled data and other projects hosted by HASH to be accessed and updated externally. _It was shut down in March 2024, as part of the migration of simulations to the main HASH application._

## HASH API

The new **HASH API** is coming soon. Further information will appear on this page in due course.
