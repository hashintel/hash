## Memory management tips

Because HASH simulations generate and save states when theyâ€™re run, they can quickly exceed a browser tab's capacity (often about 1 GB). To avoid blowing up your computer's memory, you can set HASH simulations to only save the last specified number of timesteps in memory.

To retain a set of steps, hover over the run button and choose to keep all or a specific number of time steps.

The step scrubber will show the appropriate range for the number of specified steps.

When running a simulation with only some of the steps retained, the analysis tab will only display the chart data calculated while the analysis tab is open; otherwise, it will drop those data points.
