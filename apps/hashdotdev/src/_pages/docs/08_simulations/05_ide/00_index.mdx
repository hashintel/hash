hCore is an open-source IDE for developing agent-based simulations. It provides a temporary graphical user interface for working with simulations until such time as they are natively supported within HASH itself. hCore will ultimately be deprecated, and is no longer officially supported by HASH.

This section contains various pieces of information that may be useful in using hCore:

- An overview of [keyboard shortcuts](/docs/simulations/ide/shortcuts) accessible from within hCore
- A guide to [troubleshooting crashes](/docs/simulations/ide/troubleshooting) that might occur
- Information regarding the minimum supported/recommended [system requirements](/docs/simulations/ide/system-requirements)
- Tips for [managing memory consumption](/docs/simulations/ide/memory) demands while using hCore
