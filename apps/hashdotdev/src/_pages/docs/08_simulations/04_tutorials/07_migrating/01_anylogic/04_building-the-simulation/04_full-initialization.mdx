title: "Full Initialization"
---

We've built all our logic to run this simulation, but we want to have more than just one agent of each type in our model. We're going to create a dataset to represent a network of ports, refineries, storages, etc. and use it to initialize our model. We'll also import some historical oil supply data to populate the demand gas stations experience.

## Initializing from a Network

In the AnyLogic model, the agents are initialized from a database. When the simulation starts, all of the agent values are filled in from individual properties in the db.

In HASH, we provide similar functionality through the [HASH Index](https://hash.ai/platform/index) \(hIndex\). The hIndex is a place you can find existing data or upload your own \(privately or publicly\). In this case, weâ€™ve created an [example dataset](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/ex) for the simulation that contains a network representation of the system. Now in the simulation we can upload the dataset and, in a create function, spin up agents with those properties.

```python
# initialize.py

pipelines = context.data()['@hash/ex/oil_pipelines.json']
G = nx.node_link_graph(pipelines)

for loc in pipelines['nodes']:
    if loc['type'] == 'port':
        # Create Ports
    elif loc['type'] == 'refinery':
        # Create Refineries
    elif loc['type'] == 'storage':
        # Create Storages
    elif loc['type'] == 'distributor':
        # Create Distributors
    elif loc['type'] == 'retailer'
        # Create Retailers
```

Our creator function will parse the dataset and assign the necessary properties and behaviors to every agent. An upcoming version of HASH will include a click-through wizard that will do this on your behalf.

## Initializing from Historical Data

We'll use another dataset to determine the demand **Retailers** experience. The U.S Energy Information Administration has a database that includes historical gasoline supply. We'll import [that dataset](https://simulation.hash.ai/@useia/petrol-and-liquids) and write a behavior to process the data, and allow our `initialize.js` file to use it in assigning the `avg_demand` for **Retailers**

```javascript
// process_data.js

const behavior = (state, context) => {
  const data = context.data()["@useia/petrol-and-liquids/week-supply-gas.csv"];

  // Average data so that we can access it as a yearly average.
  // Users can then specify a year to use in globals.json
  let yearly_supply = {};

  for (line of data) {
    const year = line[0].split("/")[2];
    const supply = Number(line[1]);

    // Skip NaN values
    if (isNaN(year)) {
      continue;
    }

    if (yearly_supply[year]) {
      yearly_supply[year].push(supply);
    } else {
      yearly_supply[year] = [supply];
    }
  }

  for (year in yearly_supply) {
    const supply = yearly_supply[year];
    yearly_supply[year] = hstd.stats.sum(supply) / supply.length;
  }

  state.set("yearly_supply", yearly_supply);
};
```
