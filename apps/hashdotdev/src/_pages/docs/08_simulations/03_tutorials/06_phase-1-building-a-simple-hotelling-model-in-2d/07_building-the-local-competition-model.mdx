title: "Extending the Model"
description: "Adding detail to the simulation"

We've just created a relatively simple model to demonstrate some features of competition on a spatial basis. We can try to extend this into a more realistic model of local competition by adding on some more complex behaviors, and integrating real-world data. If we think of this in phases, it might look something like this:

- **Phase 1** - Building a simple Hotelling model in 2D
- **Phase 2** - Introduces more realistic behavior for businesses and customers, and creates a more realistic environment
- **Phase 3** - Add real world data

We can add a new type of agent which represents the actual locations that a business can occupy \(since they can't actually move around to anywhere they would like\). Different location will have varying rents as well.

- **Location -** represent lots/storefronts that Businesses may occupy in the environment. Each Location agent has a square footage size and rent cost.

We can then find some data with information about vacant storefronts in a city, to finish extending the model. Check out the [Local Competition model](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/local-competition) to see how we've implemented these extensions.
