title: "Query Customers"
---

Businesses will perform two actions in this model: query customers and collect customer responses to update their position and item price.

<Hint style="info">
  
Query customers → Businesses will send their neighbors every possible position and item_price change combination.

- Position changes: `[ [-1, 0], [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1] ]`
- Item_price changes: `item_price + 1, item_price, item_price - 1`

Collect customer responses → Businesses will collect and store all the customer responses to determine the position and item_price combination with the largest profit

</Hint>

This action can be split into three separate functions within `business.js`: `send_message`, `price_messaging`, `movement_messaging`.

Let’s start with sending the message. **`send_message()`** will add messages to state.messages with a neighbor agent_id, position, item_price, and rgb. Add this function to business.js.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="business.js" >

```javascript
const send_message = (agent_id, position, price) => {
  state.addMessage(agent_id, "business_movement", {
    position,
    price,
    rgb: state.rgb,
  });
};
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Hint style="info">
  `rgb` is sent so we can visually see which business a customer chooses to shop
  at
</Hint>

The next step is to create the **`price_messaging()`** function. This function will receive the neighbor's agent_id and position change, iterate through the possible item_price values, and call send_message to notify all possible neighbors.

```javascript
const price_messaging = (agent_id, position) => {
  const item_price = state.item_price;

  send_message(agent_id, position, item_price);
  send_message(agent_id, position, item_price + 1);

  if (item_price > 1) {
    send_message(agent_id, position, item_price - 1);
  }
};
```

Notice here how we check if the `item_price` is greater than 1. This is important as we don’t want the `item_price` to drop below 0.

The final function we are going to create for querying Customers is movement messaging; however, since this will be our top level function we are going to name it **`query_customers()`**. In this function, business agents are going to iterate through their Customer neighbors and send them all possible position and item_price change combinations.

```javascript
const query_customers = (neighbors, state_position) => {
  const possible_movement = [
    [-1, 0],
    [0, 0],
    [1, 0],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
  ];

  neighbors
    .filter((n) => n.behaviors.includes("customer.js"))
    .forEach((n) => {
      possible_movement.forEach((movement) => {
        const new_position = [
          state_position[0] + movement[0],
          state_position[1] + movement[1],
          0,
        ];
        price_messaging(n.agent_id, new_position);
      });
    });
};
```

You can test your new code by placing the following snippet underneath your function declarations and looking at the Raw Output view tab.

```text
query_customers(context.neighbors(), state.position);
```

Find the messages field for a Business agent and it should be filled with “business_movement” type messages.

<Hint style="danger" >

Since Business agents are sending around 100 \(neighbors\) x 6 \(positions\) x 3 \(prices\) messages at one time, we don’t want this to occur every time step. We'll add a counter to ensure it happens at the rate we want.

1. Add the HASH shared behavior **Counter** \(shortname: @hash/counter/counter.rs\) to your simulation and add the counter behavior to your business agents BEFORE your behavior `business.js`. \(You want the counter to increment before `business.js` is called\)
1. In `init.json` give your Business agents three more variables:
1. counter: 0
1. counter_reset_at: 2
1. counter_reset_to: 0

**In the `business.js`** behavior, wrap the `query_customers()` call in the following if statement:

</Hint>

```javascript
if (state.counter === 0) {
  query_customers(context.neighbors(), state.position);
}
```

<Hint style="danger">
  The behavior **Counter** adds a counter variable to every business agent that
  will automatically increment at each time step. This ensures that
  query_customers\(\) is only called every 3 time steps.

      });
  };

  if (state.counter === 0) {
