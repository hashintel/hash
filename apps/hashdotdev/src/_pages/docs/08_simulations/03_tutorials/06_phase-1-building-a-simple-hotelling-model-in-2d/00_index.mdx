title: "Building a Simple Hotelling Model in 2D"
---

This tutorial simulates businesses competing for customers based on location and price. This extends the principles of the [Hotelling model](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/assignments/477/Hotelling29.pdf) which analyzed the optimal locations of businesses along a one-dimensional line. We will use HASH to build it in a 2D space.

This model demonstrates some basic principles of spatial and price competition.
