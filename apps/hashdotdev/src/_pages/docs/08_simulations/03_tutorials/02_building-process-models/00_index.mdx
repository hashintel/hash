Business processes are the cornerstone of every company's operations. Defined and repeatable plans for satisfying business objectives differentiate a focused, efficient machine from a disorganized mess. However, given the complexity and scale of modern businesses, it can be hard to create and optimize business processes - even simple processes are often hard to reason about or effectively optimize.

Simulation aided process design can dramatically improve results and get you answers fast.
