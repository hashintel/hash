## Rules for publishers

You must adhere to our publishing rules. This means:

- **Apps must make use of neutrally styled blocks.** See our [block design guidelines](https://hash.dev/blog/block-design).
- **Apps must not ask users for sign-in credentials.** Blocks should make use of third-party data already synced to a user's web through an existing HASH integration, or utilize the Block Protocol [Service Module](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/service). If there's an API you require access to which is not yet supported, please open an issue in the [Block Protocol repository on GitHub](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/issues/new/choose).
- **Apps should use or extend common types.** Wherever possible, these should be popular, public types already found in the Block Protocol registry.
