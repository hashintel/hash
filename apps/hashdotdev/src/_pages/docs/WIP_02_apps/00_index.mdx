## Introduction

Apps are bundles of blocks, types, and flows that together provide users with utilities or capabilities **within** their own HASH web.

Apps can be created within or added to a web, allowing them both to be used with existing entities in that web, as well as to create new entities inside the web.

You can learn more about [HASH Apps in the HASH User Guide](https://hash.ai/guide/apps).

### Apps

Apps are not yet generally available in HASH. Initially, they will be creatable within individual webs. Later, an "app store" will be launched on which users can publish and discover pre-built apps.

### App Store

Published apps will be reviewed to ensure they make use of common types and hew to best practice, ready to work in any environment. In the event a user has custom types, when importing an app, users will be able to create **semantic mappings** between the types in their graph and those from the imported app.
