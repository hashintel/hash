# Forking and Merging

HASH supports forking and merging operations. You can fork a simulation, make changes, and then create a merge request to merge the changes back into the main simulation.

Make changes to the behavior files of the simulation, and then create a merge request. `File > Create merge request`.

Merge requests are defined on the hIndex page of the simulation, where you can also view other open merge requests and approve and review the requests.

Once a merge request is approved by the main sim owner, it will automatically merge in all of the changes.
