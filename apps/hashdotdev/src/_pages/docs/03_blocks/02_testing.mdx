## Testing Blocks in HASH

When running HASH in `development` mode, the [block config menu](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/blocks#managing-blocks) displays an additional option not found in hosted `production` deployments of HASH.

Specifically, it contains the **Load block from URL** option, allowing you to load in a block from a URL to test it out during development. This option is hidden in production deployments of HASH (including that found on `hash.ai`), as well as staging deployments, and will only be present when running HASH locally in development mode.
