## Introduction

All pages in HASH, including both [docs](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/documents) and [canvases](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/canvases), are made up of **blocks**.

You can read more about [Blocks in the HASH User Guide](https://hash.ai/guide/blocks) for general information about what they are, how they can be used, and examples.

## Developing Blocks

All blocks in HASH are based on the open-source [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org), a free standard for developing blocks that work in any application which supports the protocol. At present, this includes both HASH (fully) and WordPress (experimentally, via a [plugin](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress)). As a result, anybody who knows how to code can develop blocks which are usable in HASH.
