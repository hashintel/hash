## Introduction

All pages in HASH, including both [documents](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/documents) and [canvases](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/canvases), are made up of **blocks**.

You can [read more about blocks](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/blocks) in the _HASH User Guide_ to learn more about what they are, how they can be used, and to see examples.

## Developing Blocks

Blocks are one of the most exciting ways in which HASH can be customized, extended, and made more useful. All blocks in HASH are based on the open-source [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org), a free standard for developing blocks that work in any application which supports the protocol.

At present, this includes both HASH (fully-supported) and WordPress (experimentally, via a [plugin](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress)). As a result, anybody who knows how to code can develop blocks which are usable in HASH.
