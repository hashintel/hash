title: "Adopting HASH"
---

HASH is built around the idea of incremental, optional adoption.

It should be useful in standalone, but also become more useful as you layer in additional services.

You should never have to decide to switch from one solution to HASH, without already having HASH fully functional for the use-case you care about already.

## Step 1. Connect external services

Connect up services one-by-one

## Step 2. Recreate your workflows

## Step 3. Make the switch

### Why make the switch?

- Save money, stop paying for unnecessary tools
- Centralize multiple apps in one tool
- Simplify permission management, managing access and authorization from one place
- Develop more powerful workflows that leverage **flows** and by **extending types** beyond those in legacy, vanilla external SaaS applications.

### Reasons not to switch straight away

- Keep stakeholders happy and comfortable, no need for them to switch tools immediately. Able to try out their same workflows in HASH and get used to them, without losing access to their old tools.

### Conclusion

Whether or whenever you ultimately choose to make the switch, HASH becomes more useful, the more existing tools you link to it.

By default, HASH integrations are designed to two-way sync data with the external tools and applications they connect to.
