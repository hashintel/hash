## Functional Overview

**What is HASH?** HASH is a multi-tenant, networked database with a graphical user interface. It provides individual users, as well as groups of users, with their own semantic "web" of information, drawn from different sources and platforms, or created directly with HASH. With HASH, you can:

- **aggregate information from lots of different places:** reconcile and map information to semantic 'entities' and 'types' that represent the things you care about, in a linked graph
- **sync changes to entities:** allow information changed in one system (or edited directly in HASH) to be seemlessly synced to all of the others
- **create, manage and update types:** establish data contracts; understand how updates will break things for data consumers, and who those data consumers are; improve the availability and reliability of information through full versioning and provenance trails
- **control access to information:** set visibility and edit restrictions on information; ensure compliance across systems
- **use information directly in new ways:** in addition to enhancing existing applications through two-way sync, HASH lets users reference entities, their properties and links information in pages; render information on pages using blocks, separating data from visualization logic; build whole sites, tools and apps using blocks, without writing code
- **use information to provide context to AI models:** utilize a web of typed entities to provide context to AI models

Ultimately HASH lets you eliminate competing sources of truth, and reduce information failure. HASH was created with incremental adoption in mind. Services can be integrated progressively, one-by-one, and used within or alongside HASH. At no point will you need to choose between using HASH and another system you or others in your organization are accustomed to. In the future, you'll also be able to recreate most external systems directly within HASH, through HASH's tool-building functionality, allowing for the optional, gradual, risk-free replacement and deprecation of legacy external services over time.

## Important Primitives

HASH's most important primitives are outlined on the [HASH User Guide > Core Concepts](https://hash.ai/guide/introduction/core-concepts) page.
