We're currently writing up developer-specific use cases, including those related to agent-based simulation, and entity storage/retrieval (RAG). This page will be updated shortly.

## Developer Use Cases

_We'll be fleshing this section out soon._

HASH stores information as semantic, typed entities in a linked web (i.e. a knowledge graph). This makes it particularly well-suited to:

- Providing **agent memory:** working memory to AI agents, with linked provenance records and 'confidence' scores for information.
- Acting as a **RAG-ready datastore:** as a file/datastore for use in Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines.
- Powering **agent-based simulation models:** for instantiating [agents in simulations](/docs/simulations).
