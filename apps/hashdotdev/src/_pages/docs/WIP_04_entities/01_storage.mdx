## Datastore(s)

All data in HASH is stored in a primary datastore, and one or more mirror datastores. This data is accessed by the HASH application via the **Graph Layer**.

<aside>
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, the primary datastore is Postgres. Secondary datastores include
  Weaviate (for vector storage), and OpenSearch (for full text search).
</aside>

Today, data stored in HASH is done so purely on an append-only basis. When support for **hard deletion** is introduced this will cease to be strictly true, but it will still be the primary behavior.

This means that a full version history and chain of provenance is stored for every entity in HASH.

Because of this design, the amount of information stored in an instance of HASH will generally only grow over time, resulting in a steadily increased need for storage.

  üîú Planned support for intelligent offloading: we intend to support the
  automatic intelligent transferal of information into cold storage. [View on
  roadmap ‚Üí](https://hash.dev/roadmap)

<aside>
  üîú Planned support for distributed storage: we intend to allow for horizontal
  and vertical scaling of the primary HASH Graph datastore beyond one node.

In addition, because HASH is designed to ingest a variety of different kinds of data, it is not all optimally stored in the primary or even secondary datastores.

<aside>
  üîú Planned support for optimized datastores: to account for the presence of a
  wide variety of data within HASH, we intend to support additional use-case
  optimized datastores in HASH, allowing the likes of geospatial, time-series,
  and financial accounting databases to be accessed via the HASH Graph.
  Depending on the **type** of entities being ingested, operations will be
  automatically offloaded to the most appropriate datastore, before being synced
  back out to the primary and secondary indexes (for standard querying, search,
  embedding generation, etc.) [View on roadmap ‚Üí](https://hash.dev/roadmap)

## Blobstore(s)

HASH stores binary files in S3-compatible blob storage, with corresponding metadata existing in the primary graph datastore.
