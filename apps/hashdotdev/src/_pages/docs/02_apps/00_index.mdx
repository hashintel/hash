## Introduction

Apps are bundles of blocks, types, and flows that together provide users with utilities or capabilities **within** their own HASH workspace.

Apps can be created within or added to a workspace, allowing them both to be used with existing entities in that workspace, as well as to create new entities inside the workspace.

## Immediate plans

Apps are not yet available in HASH, but are coming soon. Initial support for Apps will allow them to be created within individual workspaces.

## Future plans

Later, an App Store will be launched on which users can publish and discover pre-built apps. Published apps will be reviewed to ensure they make use of common types and hew to best practice, ready to work in any environment. In the event a user has custom types, when importing an app, users will be able to create **semantic mappings** between the types in their graph and those from the imported app.
