## Functional Overview

**What is HASH?** HASH is a new kind of operating system, platform, or _web_ that stitches together all of your data and makes it usable in new ways. More concretely, HASH lets you:

- **aggregate information from lots of different places:** reconcile and map information to semantic 'entities' and 'types' that represent the things you care about, in a linked graph
- **sync changes to entities:** allow information changed in one system (or edited directly in HASH) to be seamlessly synced to all of the others
- **manage changes to types:** establish data contracts; understand how updates will break things for data consumers, and who those data consumers are; improve the availbility and reliability of information through full versioning and provenance trails
- **control access to information:** set visibility and edit restrictions on information; ensure compliance across systems
- **use information directly in new ways:** in addition to enhancing existing applications through two-way sync, HASH lets users reference entities, their properties and links information in pages; render information on pages using blocks, separating data from visualization logic; build whole sites, tools and apps using blocks, without writing code

Ulimately HASH lets you eliminate competing sources of truth, and reduce information failure. HASH was created with incremental adoption in mind. Services can be integrated progressively, one-by-one, and used within or alongside HASH. At no point will you need to choose between using HASH and another system you or others in your organization are accustomed to. Most external systems can also be recreated within HASH, through HASH's tool-building functionality, allowing for the optional, gradual, risk-free replacement and deprecation of legacy external services over time.

## Technical Architecture

HASH combines various components into one application that runs in the cloud, and is accessible by users:

- User System: built atop Kratos
- Extensible Frontend: built atop the Block Protocol
- Datastore(s): currently Postgres, with planned support for additional specialized backends for selectively storing/offloading specific kinds of data and queries (e.g. timeseries, financial/accounting, etc.)
- Blobstore(s): currently supportive of S3-compatible APIs (with Cloudflare R2 utilized by default), with planned for support for file-type specific handlers (e.g. Cloudflare Images for images, Cloudflare Stream for video)
- HASH Graph Layer: sits on top of the datastore(s) and blobstore(s)
- Notification Service: manages the sending of in-app web and mobile push notifications, emails, SMS/MMS messages
