## Global HASH

**Joining the global web**

The easiest way to get started with HASH, or to try it out, is to use the hosted instance on the `hash.ai` website. We're currently inviting users from our wait list. Sign up at [hash.ai/signup](https://hash.ai/signup)

## Local HASH

**Running HASH on your own infrastructure**

<InfoCard variant="warning" title="Coming soon">

We're still writing our docs for self-hosting HASH, but we'll update this page when they're ready.

</InfoCard>

While we have design partners self-hosting HASH in production, we haven't yet produced our public documentation for self-hosting HASH. Once these are ready, we'll publish them here. In the meantime, if you're comfortable finding your way round a monorepo, you can check out our project on GitHub and find the Terraform files and everything else you need there. We're also happy to answer questions [over on Discord](https://hash.ai/discord).

## Which version should I use? 

**If you’re uncertain about whether HASH is right for you:** try signing up for the hosted global network instead. It’s free to sign up for, and will let you get a sense as to what HASH is all about. To learn more about what you’ll be able to do with HASH, read about the Use Cases.

**If you're a non-technical user:** ultimately we plan to make it as easy to run your own HASH instance as it is to install an app locally on your mobile or desktop device. In the meantime, if you’re a less technical user, consider signing up for HASH on the global network instead. It's a lot easier, and there are no servers or containers to set up, or upfront inrastructure costs.

**If you're still uncertain about which version to use:** you can always switch between the hosted and self-hosted versions of HASH later, without being locked in to either. Do whatever's easiest for you now and you can always change it up later. It's quicker to get started with the hosted version, so we generally recommend that. In the future we plan to allow self-hosted instances of HASH to be linked with one another and the global network. These "federated instances" will be able to see and pull public information from the global network, as well as publish to it for use by others. Right now, entity visibility settings are unique per-instance (e.g. users of hash.ai will be able to see other hash.ai user's public information, but nothing 'public' of a self-hosted user). This future data model will allow everybody to stay in control of their data, fully owning their records, while still enabling the secure, on-demand, easy-sharing of information when required.
