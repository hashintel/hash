## Scope

This blog post describes an approach to structuring JavaScript source files using the concept of fractal trees.
The solution can apply to parts of code repositories as well as cover projects as a whole.
In the context of a monorepo, the scope of this document is the internals of yarn workspaces, while the locations of the workspaces are out of scope.

## Motivation

Managing source code gets harder as the project grows.
When there are hundreds or thousands of files, it becomes difficult to decide where to write new code because things start to look messy.
Commonly emerging folders like `components`, `models` or `utils` occasionally end up collecting large quantities of unrelated code, some of which becomes obsolete.
It is not always easy to evaluate possible side effects of each change because files found next to each other can have very different impact on the rest of the codebase.

JavaScript is used in a broad range of software products.
Structuring backend, frontend or library code is often approached on the case-by-case basis, thus turning new projects (including new monorepo workspaces) into bespoke craftwork.
For the codebase to grow, collaborators need learn different folder layouts and agree on more or less unique rules in each case.

When some file structure is established in the early days of a project, it may erode over time and become obsolete.
However, fixing this structure may be costly because refactoring needs a round of debates, planning, execution, testing, etc.

The solution to these problems is a universal approach to source file structuring, which is based on the idea of fractal trees.
A new project is initiated with just one root source file and is then grown organically by following a small set of basic rules.
Project complexity is distributed across the whole tree, which makes the resulting structure robust, flexible, self-explanatory and highly scaleable.

## Principles

### The structure of the whole project is the same as of any of its parts

Fractal trees are incredibly scaleable.
No matter what part of the project we open, we want to find familiar patterns and thus confidently make changes to what we see.
A developer should not need to learn the entire project structure in order to be able to contribute to its part.
Broadly speaking, the codebase can successfully evolve even if there is no single developer who has painted a detailed picture of all source files and folders.

### Circular dependencies between files are not allowed

Creating circular import chains would turn the fractal tree into a more generic graph structure.
This would increase the complexity of the rules to follow and could also introduce runtime bugs.

### File tree grows organically, from one file to infinity

🌱 → 🌳

There is no bolierplate file structure.
A single-file project is still a fractal tree, just as a project consisting of tens of thousands of files.
In theory, a tree of any size can be packed into one file, although doing so in practice would make this file very difficult to maintain.

Resources are grouped into files by their functional purpose rather than ‘shape’.
This means that we don’t have project-wide folders like `components`, `hooks`, `services` or `types` as this would be similar to putting all CSS or HTML files next to each other.
Instead, we name and distribute the files based on their added value.
The resources that comprise a ‘feature’ (components, hooks, services, types, etc.) may remain an implementation detail of a sub-tree and do not need to be exposed outside this sub-tree.

### Resources of a sub-sub-tree are inaccessible

Each sub-tree exports resources which can be imported on the next level of the tree.
Direct imports from a sub-sub-tree is not allowed because these resources are considered ‘private’, unless re-exported.
As a result, internal modifications in a sub-tree cannot cause unexpected side-effects to the rest of the codebase.

### Shared resources may be introduced in any part in the tree

If branches of a fractal tree need to share logic (such as helper functions, constants, etc.), a shared resource is placed at the closest available ‘fork’ in the tree.
If the scope of the shared resource has changed over time, a file is moved accordingly.
Each ‘fork’ in the tree can accommodate multiple shared resources.
Each of the shared resources is a root of a fractal sub-tree by itself.

### File structure matches the _current_ state of the project

We do not need to think about file future-proofing.
It is enough to ensure that the current state of the _file_ tree represents the current state of the _logic_ tree.
Moving files is cheap and we should not worry about occasional tree reshuffling.
The structure is designed for change.

By excluding future-proofing from the process, we save time on costly debates and also avoid over-engineering.
We also allow ourselves to add formal linting checks to continuously verify file structure integrity.

## Rules

The rules are informed by the above principles, which establish the general thinking framework.
The rules, in turn, provide practical guidance to developers to ensure coherent and smooth DX.

> ℹ️ Examples below mention `.js` extension for simplicity, but they apply to TypeScript and JSX files too.

### All file and folder names are in kebab-case

Avoiding capital letters saves us from crashes on case-sensitive file systems.
For example, `import "./Foo.js"` may not work on Linux if a file is named `foo.js`.
Unlike `camelCase` and `PascalCase`, `kebab-case` also maps well into URLs and npm package names.
We use [unicorn/filename-case](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/main/docs/rules/filename-case.md) to maintain consistency in file names.

### No index.js files

These ‘special’ files enable imports from folders in Node.js.
For example, `require("./foo")` resolves `./foo` to `./foo/index.js` if the index file is present.
However, this resolution mechanism does not work in ESM imports, i.e. native web and platforms like Deno (see [their docs](https://deno.land/manual@v1.0.0/contributing/style_guide#do-not-use-the-filename-indextsindexjs)).
The author of Node.js admits he finds `index.js` files needlessly complicated (watch ‘[10 Things I Regret About Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA&t=876s)‘).

By refraining from `index.js` and implicit folder imports, we improve codebase compatibility with different runtimes.
We also protect ourselves from confusing path synonyms like `"./foo"` mapping to both `"./foo.js"` or `"./foo/index.js"`.

The entry point to an npm package can be named `main.js` instead of `index.js` which is not uncommon.

### Each file is a ‘mini-library’

A file in a fractal tree can expose one or more named exports, all of which should serve a common semantic purpose.
The name of the file summarises its contents, e.g. `maths.ts` presumably contains various maths functions and symbols.
If a file contains only one export, it is recommended to name it after that export, e.g. `import { doSomethingCool } from "./do-something-cool.js"`.
Doing so simplifies search.

When reasoning about the boundaries of a file, it is helpful to imagine this ‘mini-library’ published on npm.
If it is hard to come up with a good description for a new hypothetical package, the boundaries of the file are probably ill-defined.
It may be the case of unrelated resources being unreasonably mixed up (e.g. `utils.js` with some filesystem helpers and React hooks).

We [avoid default exports](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/defaultisbad) unless it is an external requirement.

### Outgrown files are converted into sub-trees of files

Because each file is a ‘mini-library’ on the conceptual level, all its logic except external imports can be defined in one place.
Of course, this would make some files too crowded, so distributing a ‘mini-library’ on the disk often makes sense.
When parts of a ‘mini-library’ are extracted, the new files should be placed into a folder named after the original file name.

For example, if we extract helpers named `bar` and `baz` from `path/to/foo.js`, new files are created at `path/to/foo/bar.js` and `path/to/foo/baz.js`.
New file locations communicate their relationship with `path/to/foo.js` which becomes the root of a newly created sub-tree.
Only `path/to/foo.js` is allowed to import from `path/to/foo/*.js` because this folder is considered ‘private’ from elsewhere.
If `path/to/foo.js` is no longer used, it can be safely deleted together with its ‘private’ `path/to/foo/` folder.

If any of the ‘mini-libraries’ in a sub-tree needs further splitting, the process of new file extraction repeats.
Essentially, `path/to/foo.js` can only import files from `path/to/foo/*.js` and not from `path/to/foo/bar/*.js`.
This is because `path/to/foo/bar/` is a ‘private’ folder which is only accessible from `path/to/foo/bar.js`.

There is no hard recommendation on when to split a file because situations are different.
For example, a file with a complex React component can benefit from extracting a few helper components and placing them in a subfolder (i.e. sub-tree).
However, there is no need to do this from the start if the original file in its current form has no maintenance issues.
Splitting makes sense only _when_ issues become _real_, not hypothetical.
Premature file splitting makes the folder tree larger than it could be, which is a sign of over-engineering.

For a consumer of a ‘mini-library’, the is no difference between it being a single library or a large sub-tree with thousands of files.
Internal sub-tree restructuring does not affect the exposed resources.

### All imports within a workspace use relative paths

Importing something from another workspace is straightforward: we just go for `package-name/optional/path/to/something`.
When we need to import from the same workspace, there are two options:

1.  use relative paths, e.g. `../../../foo/bar`
2.  create top-level aliases for some folders, e.g. `@/foo` for `my-workspace/src/foo`.
    [Next.js supports this style](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases); other types of workspaces can be configured to support it too.

The problem with the second approach is that it creates two correct ways of doing the same thing.
If we are in `my-workspace/x/y.ts` and we want to import from `my-workspace/a/b.ts`, we can either write `../a/b` or `@/a/b`.
Using `@/a/b` needs more setup, which is a source of tooling incompatibility, team debates and so on.
It is easier to always use relative paths.

### Shared resources are put into `shared` folders

It is not allowed to import any resource from anywhere as this can break the integrity of the fractal tree.
The location of any file unambiguously communicates the limits of its use.

If the logic of any file (i.e. ‘mini-library’) is shared between multiple sub-trees, this ‘mini-library’ is moved from its original location to `path/to/common-parent/shared/`.
The new location can be a few folders up from where resources are used, as long as `shared/` is located as deep in the tree as possible.

We can think of each `shared/` folder as of a lightweight `node_modules/` folder where each ‘package’ is a single file instead of a folder with `package.json`.
‘Mini-libraries’ like `path/to/shared/a.js` and `path/to/shared/b.js` can independently moved between `shared/` folders of the fractal tree based on their current usage.
Moving a ‘mini-library’ requires updates to import paths but this is done automatically in most modern code editors.
Linting makes sure that the result of this operation is valid.
Changing the physical location of a sub-tree does not discard its `git blame`.

Just like in the rest of the tree, files like `path/to/shared/a/x.js` are considered ‘private’ and cannot be imported from anywhere except `path/to/shared/a.js`.
To expose symbols from `path/to/shared/a/x.js`, they should be re-exported from `path/to/shared/a.js`

A shared ‘mini-library’ can import from sibling files, e.g. `path/to/shared/a.js` can contain an import from `path/to/shared/b.js` using relevant import path (`"./b.js"`).
This would be an equivalent of importing one npm package from another.

The contents of the `shared` folders closer to the tree root are also accessible, but not the other way around.
`import { a } from "../../../shared/a.js"` is allowed just as `import { a } from "./shared/a.js"`, but `import { a } from "./some/sub/tree/shared/a.js"` or `import { a } from "../../some/sub/tree/shared/a.js"` are not.

### Multiple entry points are allowed

A simple project like an npm package or an SPA starts with a single file, e.g. `main.js`.
This file works as the only entry point into the whole fractal tree, which can be of any size.
If necessary, it is possible to have multiple entry points, such as Next.js pages, executable CLI scripts, tests files and so on.
The locations of these entry points are justified by their usage, but the rules of the fractal tree still apply.

Just like the ‘mini-libraries’, tree entry points can share resources between each other by importing them from `**/shared/*.js`.

When there are multiple entry points, it is a good practice to keep their naming distinct from the ‘mini-libraries’ of the fractal tree.
This can be done with a file name suffix: `dashboard.page.jsx`, `login.handler.js`, `do-something.script.js`, `foo.test.js`.

### Unit tests are placed next to files they cover

If we want to cover `path/to/foo.js` with unit tests, we create `path/to/foo.test.js`.
Putting unit tests into a subfolder (e.g. `path/to/__test__/foo.test.js`) would make it harder to sync tests or to see what files have test files.
If `foo.test.js` becomes too big, we can see if we can write more tests for individual ‘mini-libraries’ in `path/to/foo/` instead.
This may simplify the logic in the original `foo.test.js` file.

Integration (system) tests or end-to-end tests cover the project (i.e. a library or an app) as a whole.
These high-level tests form their independent ‘fractal forest’, which is placed outside of the root of the source tree.

### Exceptions are undesired but are not prohibited

The above rules are there to organise complex projects, but they don’t require an exhaustive opt-in.
It is possible to migrate to a fractal tree structure only in selected parts of a codebase and then grow or reduce the scope of the rules over time.
The easiest way to organise existing files is to start from the ‘leafs’ and then gradually move towards the ‘root’ of a repo or a yarn workspace.

Even if the wiring between some key imports and exports is not perfect, partial adoption of fractal trees is believed to be beneficial.
It becomes easier to reason about dependencies within the parts of the codebase and this knowledge is unambiguously communicated within the team without README files or inline comments.

## Walk-through

To understand how the rules work, let’s create a new project that consists of a single file 🌱

```txt
hello.js
```

Imagine this file exports a variable named `hello` and also contains a private `calculateX` helper function that is used inside `hello`.

If the file becomes too big or if `calculateX` needs unit testing, we can extract this helper function into its own file:

```txt
hello.js
hello/
  calculate-x.js
  calculate-x.test.js (optional)
```

Putting `calculate-x` in `hello` subfolder signals that the new file can only be used inside `hello.js`.
If we add another ’private’ piece of logic for `hello.js`, (e.g. `calculate-y`), it also goes into the same folder:

```txt
hello.js
hello/
  calculate-x.js
  calculate-y.js
```

By convention, only `hello.js` is allowed to import from `calculate-x` and `calculate-y`.

Now imagine that we want to introduce a new function called `doCommonThing()` and also a concept named `bar` that would be used inside both `calculateX()` and `calculateY()` .
Based on where these new resources are used, they belong to `hello/shared/`:

```txt
hello.js
hello/
  shared/
    bar.js
    do-common-thing.js
  calculate-x.js
  calculate-y.js
```

Let’s assume that `doCommonThing` has an internal function `a` that would benefit from its own unit tests for confidence.
We get:

```txt
hello.js
hello/
  shared/
    bar.js
    do-common-thing.js
    do-common-thing/
      a.js
      a.test.js
  calculate-x.js
  calculate-y.js
```

Finally, let’s imagine that we’ve introduced another entry point called `hi.js` which depends on the concept of `bar`, but does not use `calculate-x`, `calculate-y` or `do-common-thing`.
In this case, `hello/shared/bar.js` is moved closer to the root of the tree into to a new `shared` folder.
Import paths are updated accordingly.

```txt
shared/
  bar.js
hello.js
hello/
  shared/
    do-common-thing.js
    do-common-thing/
      a.js
      a.test.js
  calculate-x.js
  calculate-y.js
hi.js
```

At each moment in time, files and folders communicate the ‘current truth’ on the relationship between various parts of the codebase.
This ability is preserved with scale.
