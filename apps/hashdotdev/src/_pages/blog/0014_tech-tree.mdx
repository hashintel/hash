## Overview

At HASH, we've brought technology trees to the real world, as part of our [product development roadmap](https://hash.dev/roadmap).

"Tech trees", as they're commonly known, are visual representations of the various ways in which progress can be made. Popularized by video games such as Civilization and StarCraft, tech trees are **directed acylic graphs** wherein each node represents a different technology, and each connecting edge has some cost associated with it.

In strategy games that cost often represents a fixed amount of time, or number of turns. In a real-life tech tree, those costs might be monetary, reputational, and temporal. And while they might be estimated, all are subject to real-world volatility, with no guarantee even of their ultimate achievability at all. That said, we're pretty confident in ours.

## The HASH Tech Tree

Each node in our tech tree has one of several states:

- Future (planned)
- Next Up (we'll be working on this in the near-term)
- In Progress (we're actively working on this)
- Working POC (we've delivered the corresponding proof of concept, which may or may not be integrated into the production app)
- Done (we've delivered a working v1 of the feature within the platform, available to all users)

Each node is also associated with one or more "use cases" of the HASH product. These use-cases are fairly broad, and we're likely to refine them in the near term, but they span knowledge and data management to agent-based modeling and retrieval system context provision.
