This is a talk I first presented at Sanity's [Structured Content Conference](https://structuredcontent.live/) in May 2022 in San Fransisco.

It's about the dream of creating more structured data on the web, the rise of block-based interfaces, and how those two intertwine. After covering a bit of history on structured data, I discuss the costs and benefits of block-based interfaces, and finally I introduce a new protocol we've been working on at [HASH](https://hash.ai). It's called the [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org) and it hopes to solve a number of issues with both structured data on the web and block-based editors.

Here's the original video recording. You can also read the full written version and see slides below.

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-2.jpg">

I like to give the punchline away early in my talks. I'm here to convince you of a thesis – that block-based interfaces can help us create _more_ structured data on the web.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-3.jpg">

We're going to tackle this in four parts; we'll first clarify _why_ we should care about structured data at all. We'll then look at the rise of **block-based interfaces** – a design pattern that's become incredibly popular over the last 5 years. We'll then consider some current problems with block-based interfaces. And finally we'll explore a [protocol](https://blockprotocol.org) that we've been working on at [HASH](https://hash.ai). The goal of it is to address many of these problems both with blocks and structured data.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-4.jpg">

First, why is it worth dreaming about a world where we have _more_ structured data than right now?

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-5.jpg">

“Structured data” means different things in different contexts, but in this talk I'm specifically going to be talking about structured data on the web.

The web is filled with content – blog posts, product descriptions, images, headlines, videos, and more. But for the most part, our computers have no clue what that content is about. That's because it's _unstructured_, meaning we haven't labelled the content in a way that makes sense to computers. In short, this content doesn't have good, standardized metadata.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-6.jpg">

So if I wanted to search the web for content on Ted Chiang's book [Exhalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories) (a great read, by the way)...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-7.jpg">

And I do a standard text search for “exhalation”, I'll get _some_ results about the book. But I'm just as likely to get results about breathing techniques or medical issues. The computer doesn't know the difference between Exhalation the book, and exhalation the biological concept. But we can fix this...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-8.jpg">

...by adding structured data.
This simply means labelling this content in a way computers can understand. We can programmatically declare a type on it.

In this case, we would declare the type “book” and declare its properties and their expected [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/types). So we would expect a book to have a _title_ which is going to be a `Text` string, and an _ISBN number_, which is going to be a `Number`.

We typically call this type of structure a _schema_ – it's a data format describing a human concept (such as Book, Person, Movie, Recipe) that declares a set of expected properties and their types.

Some of these properties will be types that have their own properties. For examples, the _author_ which is of the type _Person_. Person is going to have properties like a name, a birthday, a job title. Similarly, the property _publisher_ is going to be of the type _Company_.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-9.jpg">

To give you a practical example of what this looks like, this is what unstructured data might look like for a website about this conference. We have the title in an `<h1>` tag and the description, times, and location in `<p>` tags.

As far as the computer knows, this content is a bunch of mystery nonsense. It's human-readable but not machine-readable.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-10.jpg">

In contrast, this is what it would look like as structured data. This is the same event written up in JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data), which is currently the most popular and widely used format across the web.

We can see it declares that this thing is of the type _Event_, and has properties like a start date and an end date. It also has a location which is of the type _Place_, which in turn has an _Address_.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-11.jpg">

At this point, some people are thinking this all sounds very familiar. What I'm describing is the semantic web.

The semantic web is a dream that began over 20 years ago when Tim Berners-Lee wrote [an article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225070375_The_Semantic_Web_A_New_Form_of_Web_Content_That_is_Meaningful_to_Computers_Will_Unleash_a_Revolution_of_New_Possibilities) describing the possibilities of a web that could be read by machines.

This dream, that the whole web would become interoperable structured data, promised a bright future of frictionless automation and rich user experiences.

It's a beautiful dream, but to put it lightly, it's become complicated. The dream is enormously ambitious. And it's run into a number of problems since the original proposition.

At this point I'll say I'm _not_ a semantic web expect, and this is a very touchy area, so I'll tread lightly. But there are a number of well known issues most people agree upon...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-12.jpg">

<p>
  First, ontologies – meaning the schemas we define for types like “Person” or
  “Book” – are always culturally relative and subjective. There is no universal
  single set of properties we can all agree upon. This is because human culture
  is inherently pluralistic. That's perhaps the whole point of human culture.
  It's a mechanism to create wildly diverse ways of seeing and being in the
  world. So diverse it makes it impossible to agree on fundamental categories
  and properties for what exists around us.
</p>

Take the type “Person” for example. On [schema.org](https://schema.org), the
largest and widely used repository of schemas (maintained by Google), a
_Person_ has the properties _first name_ and _last name_. But in a great many
cultures, people do not have first and last names. That's not how they name
people. People may have multiple personal names, family names, and clan names
that change depending on who is addressing them and in what context. None of
these fit neatly into two boxes on a form.

Similarly, the type _Postal Address_ might seem like something with a rigid
structure. In places like the United Kingdom, we have strict formats for house
numbers, street names, and postal codes. But in some places, street addresses
have not been standardised and formalised by their governments. Someone's
address might be “go 200 meters past the temple and it's the fourth house on
the left.” Try putting that into your schema.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-13.jpg">

<p>
  The second issue is competing formats. Over the years people have proposed
  many different ways to implement structured data on the web. There's{" "}
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>{" "}
  and RDFa, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a>, and{" "}
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat">Microformats</a>
</p>

Then there are all the annotation frameworks, query languages, and vocabularies that interact with these formats like [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language), [FOAF](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)>), [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), [Turtle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)>), and more.

You are probably overwhelmed by that list, and so are all the developers who are supposed to use them to make the dream of the semantic web come to life. It's not surprising most developers don't bother adding structured data to their sites.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-14.jpg">

Third, there are incentive issues. It takes a lot of developer labour to add semantic markup to a website, and doesn't offer immediate benefits in return. Structured data can certainly improve SEO and content discovery, but beyond that we haven't found enough compelling use cases for it for creators and publishers.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-14a.jpg">

<p>
  Lastly, the ambitious scale of the semantic web compounds all the above
  problems. Trying to structure data across the <i>entire web</i> leads to
  issues of complexity.
</p>

All these problems have made a lot of people skeptical about the feasibility of the semantic web. They're quite keen to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-15.jpg">

The debate about the semantic web has devolved into an unhelpful binary.

On one side we have people insisting that structured data on the web has failed and will never work.

And on the other side we have people who are adamant that we need to fulfil the dream of a fully semantic web.

This conversation doesn't leave a lot of room for nuance.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-16.jpg">

What's we're missing here is the sensible middle ground of opportunity. There's plenty of value in pursuing structured data at a smaller scale. It's much easier to agree upon and maintain ontologies within companies, sets of companies, academic institutions, and communities.

The original idea wasn't the problem, only the scale of it.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-17.jpg">

Structured data is clearly useful. In fact, it's already actively used and useful across the web now. The most common use case you've likely heard of is around enabling SEO and “rich results” in search engines.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-18.jpg">

If I search for a recipe like “carrot cake” on the search engine Bing, I get a page filled with useful information like images, ratings, keywords, and Wikipedia data. All without needing to navigate to individual results pages. This is a much better experience than seeing a wall of text.

Bing knows which sites contain carrot cake recipes and can surface details from those recipes because they contain structured data.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-19.jpg">

Similarly, if I search for the book “The Dawn of Everything” on Google, I get page showing me key information about the book. But I also get a row of options for where to buy this book and how much it costs.

Which means Google knows the difference between sites that are simply mentioning or reviewing this book, versus which ones are selling it as a product. This distinction is only possible because of structured data.

Search results are perhaps our best modern success story of leveraging structured data in user interfaces.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-20.jpg">

Second, structured data can help us manage content in a way that leads to adaptable, more sophisticated UX. This use case is what most of the people at this conference are focused on.

Structuring content just within a single company can lead to enormous benefits. Tools like _Sanity_ are one way to do this. It allows us to adapt and reuse content within many contexts.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-21.jpg">

This is an example of a content model from the book [Designing Connected Content](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-connected-content/9780134764061/). It shows a set of entities, properties, and relationships related to an Event type. This sort of structured content modelling allows us to create interfaces that provide users with a clear [mental model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/) of the things they're interacting with. It also makes it easy to define these pieces of data in one central place and flexibly reuse them across devices, platforms, and contexts.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-22.jpg">

Lastly, structured data makes life much easier for data scientists and academics. Data scientists in particular have trouble getting good quality data off the web. They often have to scrape websites, download messy data files, then manually clean, label, and format the data before they can work with it. Structured data eliminates much of that work.

There's also a lot of interest from the academic community around “knowledge graphs”, which are structured ontologies they use to share knowledge within specific domains.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-23.jpg">

Let's jump back to our structured data binary for a moment. Right now we're about here on the spectrum of no structured data to all structured data. A very small percentage of content on the web is encoded with structured data.

We also don't have a lot of accessible, high-quality software that helps us create and publish more structured data.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-24.jpg">

I think a practical question we should all be asking is how do we get _here_? Rather than trying to make the _whole_ web structured data, how do we simply nudge this arrow slightly further along to the right?

The goal is _more_ structured data, not _all_ structured data.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-25.jpg">

One of the major barriers to this goal is that almost all our existing tools related to structured data are designed to serve developers.

Most of the focus of the semantic web movement has gone into creating syntax formats like RDF, OWL, and JSON-LD. There's also been a lot of effort put into convincing developers to join the cause. Rather than other people who are involved in making content on the web, like designers, product people, and content strategists.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-26.jpg">

And _this_ is a really rough user interface to work in. And it's certainly not accessible to most people.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-27.jpg">

Which brings us to a prescient question: how do we make it easier for everyone to create structured data?

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-28.jpg">

Or put more specifically, what type of interfaces might enable non-developers to create structured data?

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-29.jpg">

So, I have a hypothesis for this question. And you can probably guess what it is... [blocks](https://hash.ai/glossary/blocks)!

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-30.jpg">

I now want to talk to you about the huge surge in blocks and composable interfaces we've seen over the last five years.

But first, what exactly do I mean by a “_block_”?

Well, you have almost certainly seen and used a block.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide video width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-31.mp4">

_This is a video - click play on the slide_

Most of you will have encountered blocks in knowledge-management apps like _Notion_, which have (arguably) been responsible for a huge boom in awareness and popularity of blocks.

This is what the interface looks like. You begin on a page, type the slash command, and a menu appears where you can select a block from a list of pre-made formats. Such as a header, bullet point list, or a table. You can then enter data into that block and change the state of it. You can drag and drop these blocks around to arrange them however you like, including in side-by-side columns.

You're essentially able to create very powerful layouts and formats with a very simple set of interface patterns.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide video width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-32.mp4">

_This is a video - click play on the slide_

To show another example, this is _Coda_, a somewhat more advanced block-based editor. You can see here they have quite a long list of block types to pick from.

I can embed rich media like tweets, or query an external API like that of the _Unsplash_ image library. All from within a friendly set of user interface components, and without writing any code.

This might not seem that impressive to you. We've become slightly jaded about these type of interfaces; WYSIWYG direct manipulation interfaces are taken for granted. But creating something like this would have been prohibitively complex just 5 years ago.

This is all _very_ difficult to do if you're working in native web languages like HTML, CSS, and JS. For people who don't know how to code, block-based interfaces allow them to author rich media documents and publish them to the web in a couple of clicks. They're a huge leap forward in democratizing web publishing.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-33.jpg">

The interface patterns in block-based editors have already become quite consistent and standardized. In most of them you can type `/` and get a dropdown list of block options.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-34.jpg">

In some of the more complex ones, they present blocks in a sidebar or configuration panel. But generally everyone has converged on a standardized format for how these editors work. Which is great for users who don't have to relearn the patterns for every new app.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-35.jpg">

So now that we've seen a couple of examples of block-based interfaces, I want to give you a more concise definition of a “block”

I define it as a single unit of content...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-36.jpg">

...within a document or canvas...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-37.jpg">

...that can be flexibly composed and rearranged...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-38.jpg">

...and has a _type_ that determines how it displays data.

So a table obviously lays data out in rows and columns...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-39.jpg">

...while a kanban lays it out in a set of cards.

Another key feature of blocks is you can _change that type_ while the data inside the block stays the same. This means we have a separation of the data from the view. So a set of kanban cards could become...

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-40.jpg">

...an image gallery.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-41.jpg">

And critically, blocks allow _end-users_, meaning anyone who is _not_ a professional developer, to create, edit, and delete the data within these blocks. All without writing any code. The users are in control of the data rather than the developers.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-42.jpg">

Blocks also enable what I call _modular, composable interfaces_. Open canvases where users can drag and drop blocks into place like legos. These are easy to use and accessible to a much wider audience than any markup or syntax could hope to be.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-43.jpg">

These types of interfaces are obviously very **powerful** and **popular**. And to explain why I'm going to reference a quote from [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), who co-founded [HASH](https://hash.ai), as well as companies like _Stack Overflow_, _Trello_, and _Glitch_.

In his [announcement post for Trello](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2012/01/06/how-trello-is-different/), he said "The great horizontal killer applications are actually just fancy data structures."

By "horizontal" he means applications that have a wide range of uses cases. Things like spreadsheets and word processors. Apps you can use for everything — from financial analysis to grocery shopping lists.

The reason these apps are great for such a broad range of use cases is they give users really strong data structures to work within.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-44.jpg">

And I think block-based apps are becoming the meta-medium for horizontal apps. They're a material with the potential to do whatever you need them to. They allow you to _pick your own_ fancy data structures from a wide list.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-45.jpg">

Unsurprisingly, block-based apps have started popping up everywhere. There are three main categories they fall into.

The first is documents, wikis, and knowledge management systems. The kinds of apps people use for note-taking or team communications. This is the most popular use case at the moment.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-46.jpg">

The second is WYSIWYG website builders and web publishing platforms. This includes platforms like WordPress's Gutenberg editor, Squarespace, and Webflow. They're explicitly designed to help you create standard web designs like landing pages, contact forms, and blogs.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-47.jpg">

The third category that's just starting to take shape is what I'm calling “Do-it-Yourself SaaS tooling.” These apps give users to ability to create their own interfaces with a lot more programmatic functionality baked in. You can usually query a separate data source, add "if this, then that" logic to elements, and define more advanced block functionality like filterable lists and dropdown selectors.

Rather than subscribing to ten different SaaS services, these apps are beginning to let you build your own solutions.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-48.jpg">

The lines between these categories are quite fuzzy. I think of it as a spectrum of block-based paradigms. Each app frames what you're creating slightly differently. Some present it as a document, some as a website, and some as a fully-fledged app.

But they're all following the same interface patterns to do it. The difference between these block-based editors become window dressing when you begin to look closely at what they actually make possible.

This is why so many people have ended up using tools like Notion as website builders, despite the fact that these tools were never built with the expectation of that happening.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-49.jpg">

But I think the _real_ benefit of these block-based applications – the reason they're so widely used – is they **shift power from developers to users**.

They give users agency over what the app can do. Users are given a set of tools with enough flexibility to solve their own problems. Rather than developers, designers, and product managers imagining hypothetical problems for the user, and then imposing their ideas of how an app 'should' work to solve those problems.

Obviously, block-based interface do not _fully_ hand over control to the user. But they enable more [end-user programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) to take place. And they're doing it in a way that was frankly impossible just 5 years ago.

If 5 years ago I wanted to put a table of data onto a website, I would be writing the HTML, CSS, and JS for that myself. And it would definitely not be as good as the table Coda or Notion give me. And now I can do it in two clicks.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-50.jpg">

We've established that blocks are wildly popular, and they enable hundreds of thousands of people to publish rich, complex documents to the web.

So, what's the problem here? And how does this relate to structured data?

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-51.jpg">

First, blocks are proprietary to individual applications, and can't be moved between applications.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-52.jpg">

If I have a block that I love using in one of my apps – probably because it's well designed and easy to interace with – I'm only able to use it within that app.

Let's say there's a block that renders LaTeX beautifully in my note-taking app. But I also want to publish LaTeX code to my website and my company wiki. But those apps don't have blocks that render LaTeX. I'm now stuck. There's no way for me to port the LaTeX block across applications.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-53.jpg">

Closely related to that: an _enormous_ number of developer hours are spent reinventing the same blocks over and over.

Most of these apps have the same basic types of blocks; header, checklist, table, image, embed, etc. But every team of developers has to build their own set of these.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-54.jpg">

If we look at the kanban block in Notion, Coda, and ClickUp, we'll notice they all work the same. They offer the same basic functionality, format, and interactions. But the developers had to build each of these seperately. (**Editor's note:** take for example apps like WordPress, DayOne and Tumblr — each of these from the single same company, Automattic, each using the exact same framework, Gutenberg, and yet each today has their _own_ 'image' block, developed separately without shared abstractions to build upon)

Anyone building a new block-based app will have to build their own kanban board component for it, or heavily modify an existing one, even though this is a solved problem.

This is a waste of time and energy for developers. It's also frustrating for users, who have to learn slightly different interface patterns for each application. Even when their blocks all do the same thing in the end.

</TalkSlide>

The next issue is that users only get access to a limited range of blocks.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-56.jpg">

Users are given between 30-70 blocks in each of these applications, and usually on the lower end of that range.

Here's the block picker dropdown in an app _Clover_ with a fairly typical list of options.

Compare this to what your everyday React developer has access to. If I hop onto the _npm_ package manager for JavaScript, and search for “react components”, I get over 64,000 results to pick from. Obviously, not all of these components are going to be block-like things. Many will be utilities or helpers.

But this still shows there is a huge discrepancy between the power and choice developers have when constructing an interface compared to users.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-58.jpg">

The final and biggest problem with proprietary blocks is that there's no structured data behind these blocks. Which in turns leads to poor data interoperability between platforms.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-59.jpg">

A table in Wordpress Gutenberg and a table in Notion appear to have the same data structure on the surface. They both have values stored in rows are columns. But they're built differently on the back-end. They're not _designed_ to be shareable. This means we can't easily pass data from a Gutenberg table into a Notion table.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-60.jpg">

Which brings me to our last section: the Block Protocol!

The [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org) is a project by [HASH](https://hash.ai) that hopes to address some of these problems.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-61.jpg">

It specifies a standardized way for any block to communicate with any block-based application.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-62.jpg">

But rather than these two systems talking directly to one another as they like, they instead both communicate in a way defined by the protocol. The protocol in essence provides a shared set of terms for negotiation between the two parties. A bit like a set of rules about what you can say and how you should say it.

Any block that talks to this protocol can talk to any application that also speaks to it, and vice versa.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-63.jpg">

This makes it possible to embed blocks that follow the protocol into any app that also follows the protocol.

The developers of the block and the application don't have to know anything about one another, or co-ordinate their efforts. But they can make their software compatible through the protocol.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-64.jpg">

Embedding is great, but what we really want here is _data exchange_.

Our app has a data store that it controls. And our block wants to create new data. Let's say we've made a table block and typed some information into it.

Using the protocol, our block can send that data to the app's data store. It can then do all the standard operations you would expect. It can create new data, update existing data, delete data, and read data from the app.

Obviously, the block can only make these changes with the _permission_ of the app. There are certainly security implications here we're anicipating and building accomodations for.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-65.jpg">

Blocks can also send data to one another, which leads to some dynamic interactivity between them.

I like to think of these as [oEmbeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OEmbed) or [iframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Frames) with CRUD operations built-in.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-66.jpg">

Well, **so what?**

Why do we care that all this embedding, data exchange, and interactivity is possible?

First of all, it means that any independent developer can build a block. Then anyone else can put that block into their application. And _it'll work_ without requiring extra dev work. As long as they both use the protocol.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-67.jpg">

But really, **so what?** What does this mean in terms of practical user benefits?

Well, in this hopeful world, users would be able to pick from a much wider variety of blocks.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-68.jpg">

At the moment users get this limited list of 30 or so basic blocks.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-69.jpg">

But we would love to make it possible for users to have hundreds or thousands of specialized blocks to pick from. They should have a much wider variety of types avaliable in their apps. People be able to pick from weirder, niche blocks like recipe creators, data visualisation displays, flight path trackers, or financial planners.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-70.jpg">

Secondly, applications would get access to this wider range of blocks for little or no extra developer work.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-71.jpg">

Each app would be able to make this infinite list of block options available. Which saves the developers building those apps from having to make all these block types themselves, or rebuild a table block for the 100th time.

It also offers their end-users a much better experience. Which is the whole point of their company.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-72.jpg">

Lastly, this protocol makes it easier to create structured data and encourages more data interopability.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-73.jpg">

Blocks that follow the protocol must declare a schema – an expected data structure.

So a to-do list block would expect to reviece a set of `Task` items.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-74.jpg">

And that `Task` will have an expected list of properties like a `title`, `description`, `status`, and `dueDate`. We declare these in a JSON object and valiadate them with [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-75.jpg">

This means that blocks can be designed to fit specific data structures, rather than all being generic formats.

We could have very specialised block types like a Flight Map block that takes in a `Flight` data structure, or a Movie Review block that takes in a `Movie` data structure.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-76.jpg">

This gives us an interesting new interplay of data and views. We can start with structured data – with specific concepts – and then find a block that's specifically designed to display it.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-77.jpg">

The power of this can best be explained by a quote from the late, great Christopher Alexander: “Design is finding a form to fit a context”

Structured data is a kind of context, and blocks give us the flexibility to find the right form for it.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-78.jpg">

There's also another layer to this. We can go the other direction and use blocks to _create_ structured data.

We can start with a block which has a user-friendly interface to input and edit data. And once we've typed values into it, the block can create the structured data for us, because it already has a schema defined. And this is all a much better user experience than writing JDON-LD or RDF code syntax.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-79.jpg">

So this is all a lovely idea, but I'm sure many of you are already thinking of all the horrendous ways this could go wrong.

There are plenty of challenges and problems with trying to build this protocol, and we're actively working on them in public. The current [specification](https://blockprotocol.org/spec) of the protocol is an early alpha draft that we're looking for feedback on.

A few of the major challenges we have draft solutions for are security and sandboxing for untusted blocks, maintaining consistent UX and styling across blocks, and handling schema divergence.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-80.jpg">

There's many more of these. We have an [FAQ](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/faq) page with extensive answers written for each of these. We're always looking to add more so feel free to [get in touch](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) if your question isn't answered.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-81.jpg">

The bigger picture goal of this whole project is to create a virtous cycle. We want people to create blocks, so that blocks can create structured data, so that people have access to more structured data to reuse in blocks.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide width="1362" height="766" src="/blog/0007_block-paved-path/block-path-82.jpg">

In turn, we hope this leads to better user experiences, better data science, and eventually better decision-making tools, like [HASH](https://hash.ai/). Thank you!
