# Applications

## About this directory

This `apps` directory contains the source-code and/or content for a number of HASH's projects and websites.

## HASH

[HASH], is a block-based, data-centric, all-in-one workspace.

See the [`README`](hash/README.md) in the [`hash`](hash) folder for a holistic description of the workspace, and instructions for running it or testing it.

The workspace depends on a suite of constituent services, which are briefly described below, keep in mind that they are not guaranteed to be useful when ran independently.

| Subdirectory             | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hash-frontend`          | The main entrypoint for the Next.js frontend (graphical user interface) of the HASH workspace application.                                                                   |
| `hash-api`               | The main entrypoint for the Node.js server that serves the core of the backend API of HASH.                                                                                  |
| `hash-graph`             | The query layer over the main datastore of HASH, its strongly-typed graph.                                                                                                   |
| `hash-external-services` | Defines the running configurations of external (not internally-developed) services that HASH depends on, such as Postgres, Ory Kratos, and Temporal. _(pending refactoring)_ |
| `hash-realtime`          | Implements a different view over the graph datastore that allows services to subscribe to realtime updates on entities.                                                      |
| `hash-search-loader`     | Loads the change-stream published by the realtime service into a search index.                                                                                               |
