# About this directory

This `apps` directory contains the source-code and/or content for a number of HASH's public-facing websites, including:

- [hash.ai](https://hash.ai/): our main website
- [hash.dev](https://hash.dev/): our developer-focused website

In future it will also be extended to contain our product _applications_, as well (namely anything that can be _run_, with an
entry point or interface you can launch). Apps may (but are not guaranteed to) be independently useful.

The source code for the Block Protocol website can be found in the `apps/site` subdirectory of the [blockprotocol/blockprotocol repo](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/apps/site) on GitHub.

Our [hash.community](https://hash.community/) Discourse forum source can be found in our private [hashintel/internal monorepo](https://github.com/hashintel/internal), but should be added here in due course.
