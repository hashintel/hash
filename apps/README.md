# About this directory

This `apps` directory contains the source-code and/or content for a number of HASH's public-facing websites, including:

- `engine`: houses the codebase of our next-generation version of [HASH Engine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine) - a versatile agent-based simulation engine written in Rust
- `hash-*` directories: these house the applications that together form [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash). These apps may (but are not guaranteed to) be independently useful.
- [hash.ai](https://hash.ai/): our main website
- [hash.dev](https://hash.dev/): our developer-focused website

The source code for the Block Protocol website can be found in the `site` subdirectory of the [blockprotocol/blockprotocol repo](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/site) on GitHub.
