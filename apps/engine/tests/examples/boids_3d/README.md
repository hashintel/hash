Demonstrates the "Boids" flocking algorithm in both 2d and 3d space.

To determine where a boid moves, it follows three rules:

- **alignment:** steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- **cohesion:** steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
- **separation:** steer to avoid crowding local flockmates

To change between 2D and 3D edit the "dimension" in the Properties tab.

By modifying the simulation properties, different flocking behaviors and formations will occur.
