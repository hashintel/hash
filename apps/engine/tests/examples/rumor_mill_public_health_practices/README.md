This simulation models the spread of hygiene practices in a community, and their trust in a federal authority.

Agents pass on messages to randomly chosen neighbors based on their current hygiene and trust levels, creating blocks of agents with similar levels.

The height of each agent represents their hygiene score, and their color represents their level of trust in federal messaging.
