# HASH Core

[HASH Core](https://hash.ai/platform/core?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_core) (**hCore**) is a self-contained, in-browser environment for building and interfacing with agent-based simulations compatible with [HASH].

It uses a legacy version of hEngine which is no longer maintained, separate from the primary [HASH Engine] (**hEngine**) found in this repository.
