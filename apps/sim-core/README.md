# HASH Core

[HASH Core] (**hCore**) is a self-contained, in-browser environment for building and interfacing with agent-based simulations compatible with [HASH].

It uses a legacy version of hEngine which is no longer maintained, separate from the primary [HASH Engine] (**hEngine**) found in this repository.

_The hCore source code will be made available here shortly._
