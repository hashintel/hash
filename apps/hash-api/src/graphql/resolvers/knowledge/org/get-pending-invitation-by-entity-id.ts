 * This resolver is used specifically to get an invitation to an organization issued to a user not yet signed up for HASH.
 * They will be emailed a link to sign up, which includes the entityId, and we need to retrieve it to show the invitation details on the signup page.
 * We cannot have any authentication gate on this as the user does not have an account, but the security risk is minimal
 * – the user needs to have id, and it's vanishingly unlikely anyone can guess a webUuid–uuid combo that happens to match an active one.
