 * 1. Activity sends a Signal to the Workflow requesting data from the outside world when it encounters a need for it
 * 2. The outside world is polling for these requests (resolved by finding the signals in the event history, for now)
 * 3. The outside world sends a Signal back to the Workflow with the requested data
 * 4. The Workflow allows the response to be accessed via a Query
