This task will include specifying the relationship between Google and these companies as subsidiaries.\n\n4. **Prepare and Submit Data**:\n - Once the subsidiaries are identified and confirmed from the web page, propose and submit these company entities using the submitProposedEntities tool.\n\n5. **Final Review and Completion**:\n - Review all the obtained and submitted information to ensure everything is correct and comprehensive. After final verification, use the complete tool to finalize the task.\n\nBy following this detailed plan, we can efficiently use the available tools to find and document the subsidiaries of Google, fulfilling the research task as required.\n    If you want to deviate from this plan, update it using the "updatePlan" tool.\n    You must call the "updatePlan" tool alongside other tool calls to progress towards completing the task.',
