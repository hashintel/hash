# Where do these files come from?

These folders contain email templates for Kratos emails. They copy the default directory layout that Kratos will look for. Only the email flows we're using are present here.

Kratos default templates are located here: https://github.com/ory/kratos/tree/v0.11.0/courier/template/courier/builtin/templates and may change between versions of Kratos.
