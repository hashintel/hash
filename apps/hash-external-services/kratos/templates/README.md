# Where do these files come from?

These folder contain email templates for Kratos emails. They copy of the default directory layout that Kratos will look for. Only the email flows we're using are present here.

They follow the file structure and names located here: https://github.com/ory/kratos/tree/v0.11.0/courier/template/courier/builtin/templates which may change between versions of Kratos.
