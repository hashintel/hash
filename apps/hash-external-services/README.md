# HASH External Services

## Overview

This directory contains a number of external services used throughout HASH (Ory Kratos, OpenSearch, Postgres, and Temporal).

### LLM prototyping

This also contains an experimental Docker compose file for prototyping LLM-based services using relevant external services such as a vector database.
You'll be able to execute the following command from the repository root directory to start the prototyping external services:

```sh
yarn external-services:prototype up
```

As with other external services, the arguments passed after the script name are arguments for `docker compose`.

## Future plans

These will be migrated into semantic folders in the future. For example, within the `apps` folder:

1.  `hash-external-services/kratos` → `hash-authentication`
1.  `hash-external-services/opensearch` → `hash-search`
1.  `hash-external-services/postgres` → `hash-database`
1.  `hash-external-services/temporal` → `hash-executor`

## Database Backups

It is possible to set up automated PostgreSQL backups using an additional service. You can add this service directly to the desired `docker-compose` or add another `docker-compose` as a layered config.

You can add the following service:

```yaml
postgres-backup:
  image: kartoza/pg-backup:15-3.3
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: "${POSTGRES_USER}"
    POSTGRES_PASS: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
    POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
    POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
    # Change the name of the dumps here
    ARCHIVE_FILENAME: "$$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S').gz"
    # These are the args passed to the `pg_dump` command
    # read more at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html#PG-DUMP-OPTIONS
    # `-p` ensures that SQL can be easily transferred between versions
    # `--if-exists` is important here, as several databases (most notably `realtime`) already create schemas, which would otherwise lead to an error while applying the backup.
    DUMP_ARGS: -Fp -Z9 --if-exists
    # Change the cron here for the desired backup schedule
    # This is set to 00:00 UTC every day
    CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 0 * * *"
    REMOVE_BEFORE: 14
  volumes:
    # Change here for the desired backup location
    - /tmp/backups:/backups
```

This will add backups to the `/tmp/backups` location at the desired schedule (change as needed.)

To apply the backups you can use:

```bash
# we use `-c -f` here to force output, `pg-backup` always ends archives with `.dmp`, which gunzip will otherwise refuse to uncompress
# You can skip this step if you haven't compressed (`-Z`) the backup.
gunzip -c -f /local/registry/backups/[date].dev_kratos.dmp > .tmp
./compose.sh -T --env PGPASSWORD=[password] postgres psql --user postgres dev_kratos -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < .tmp

gunzip -c -f /local/registry/backups/[date].dev_graph.dmp > .tmp
./compose.sh -T --env PGPASSWORD=[password] postgres psql --user postgres dev_graph -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < .tmp
```

You do **not** need to restore the `globals.sql` file, the init script of the postgres container already does this for you.

The `./compose.sh` file is an alias script, meant to ease the use of the lengthy docker compose command, and should look somewhat like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# `docker-compose.prod.yml` contains local overrides to the production docker compose file, like custom volume mounts or the backup solution.
sudo docker compose --file apps/hash-external-services/docker-compose.prod.yml --file docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod ${@}
```
