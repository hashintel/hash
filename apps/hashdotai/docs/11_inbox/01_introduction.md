Your inbox contains messages and actions.

Actions may correspond to [notifications], or be standalone things. Actions can be triggered by:

- other [users] when they [share] or [mention] you
- third-party service [integrations]
- [flows], which may have a "human in the loop" step, or otherwise require some action if they become stuck
- [apps] you create or install
