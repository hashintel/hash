By pressing `@` on your keyboard when in a [text block] you can insert a wide variety of 'chips' which provide rich information within documents.

## Entity chips

## Datetime chip

## Currency chip

**Coming soon.** By pressing `$`, `€` or `£` on your keyboard, you can insert a 'currency chip'. This lets you display a monetary amount in a particular currency at a specific point in time, making it easy to see changes in its relative value over time ("today's value" inflation) or across exchange rates (forex conversions). Support for additional currencies is planned.
