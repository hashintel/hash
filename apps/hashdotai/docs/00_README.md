# Overview

## HASH

HASH is a knowledge management and decision-making platform that can be [self-hosted](https://github.com/hashintel/hash), or used online at [app.hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/).

Whichever version of HASH you're using, your data is private by default -- visible only to you -- unless you explicitly choose to make it public.

In the future, instances of HASH will (optionally) be able to talk to and sync data with one another, as well as run in secure isolation.

## Graphs

Every account (both those of **users** and **organizations**) in [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) has their own _graph_. An account's graph acts as its canonical reference, or primary "source of truth" for representing the world around.

Graphs contain [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities) conforming to a set of [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types) which define their [properties](https://hash.ai/glossary/properties).

Users can create or update entities in their graph directly through the HASH user interface, or by connecting external applications or sources via the **integrations** menu.

Entities in graphs can be easily accessed via the HASH API, and instantiated directly in simulations without data processing.
