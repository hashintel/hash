# Introduction to Pages

## Anatomy of a Page {#anatomy-of-a-page}

Pages are made up of several elements:

1.  A **Title** and an **Emoji icon** (“Page Title” and the #️⃣ icon below). These serve to quickly explain what a Page is about and appear in the “PAGES” section in the left side-bar as well as in breadcrumbs at the very top of each. \

1.  **Blocks** (demonstrated with the H1, Paragraph, Callout, and Code Blocks below). Every piece of content inside of a Page is a Block—a third-party component which can render and manipulate data. Blocks are laid out vertically and can be re-ordered. \

1.  **Comments** (shown below on the right of the Paragraph Block). Comments are attached to Blocks and allow users to augment the content in Blocks with additional questions and thoughts.

## Organizing and navigating Pages {#organizing-and-navigating-pages}

You will find all of the Pages within your Workspace in the left side-bar under “PAGES”. Pages belong to the Workspace in which they were created and cannot be moved. You can drag and drop the Pages in the side-bar to reorder them.

## Creating a Page {#creating-a-page}

The + button next to “PAGES” lets you create a new Page. You can also create a new page using the + button in the top-nav. New Pages are added to the bottom of the Pages list in the left side-bar.

## Archiving a Page {#archiving-a-page}

You can archive a Page if you no longer need it by clicking the […] button to the right of its title in the side-bar and selecting “Archive page”. Archived pages do not appear in the side-bar and cannot be found through the UI but will still load if you have their URL. A banner at the top of an archived page makes it clear the page is archived.

## Subpages {#subpages}

Pages can have an unlimited number of subpages. In terms of features, subpages are identical to Pages, differing only in that they are nested under a parent Page in the left side-bar. A Page with subpages will have a chevron icon button on the left of its title in the side-bar. Clicking this icon will show or hide the list of subpages. When viewing a subpage, breadcrumbs at the very top of the page will show its parent Page or Pages.

## Sharing Pages in read-only mode {#sharing-pages-in-read-only-mode}

Pages in HASH are accessible to anyone with the link but only logged in users who are members of the Workspace which owns the page can edit it. To share a Page with a collaborator who is not a member of your Workspace, simply copy the URL from your browser’s address bar or click the [...] menu on the right of the Page’s title in the side-bar and select “Copy link to page”.
