# Introduction

## What is HASH?

HASH is a knowledge management and decision-making platform that can be [self-hosted](https://github.com/hashintel/hash), or used online at [app.hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/).

Whichever version of HASH you're using, your data is private by default -- visible only to you -- unless you explicitly choose to make it public.

In the future, instances of HASH will (optionally) be able to talk to and sync data with one another, as well as run in secure isolation.
