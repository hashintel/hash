# Signing up at hash.ai

Using the hosted version of HASH at app.hash.ai is the fastest way to get started.


# Hosting your own instance

A fully usable, open-source version of HASH is available. In fact, all of the code which powers this website (app.hash.ai) is publicly available, meaning it is freely available for anybody to inspect and review. If you're technically minded, you can learn more about our open-source mission and find links to our source code at [hash.dev](https://hash.dev/).

What this also means is that anybody can host their own instance of HASH. In other words, if you'd like to run HASH locally on your own servers, rather than in the cloud, you can. This also means there's no risk of vendor lock-in, and you are not beholden to HASH as you might be any other provider.


# Navigating HASH {#navigating-hash}

!["The HASH interface"](https://hash.ai/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/EipKtqu98OotgfhvKf6Eew/7e719229-7e04-448a-1456-fa549cf94800/public)

The HASH interface is an all-in-one, browser-based, no-code workspace made up of three main panels:

1.  The **top-nav**, where you’ll see the workspace switcher and options to create new Pages, Entity Types, and Entities.
1.  The **left side-bar**, where you’ll find your account options alongside panels for managing Pages and Types.
1.  The **center pane**, where Types, Entities, Pages, and Blocks are viewed and manipulated.
