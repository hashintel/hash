# Python

We run Python3 in the browser through [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) and [currently support all of the packages that Pyodide does](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages).

**The packages below have proven particularly popular with modelers using HASH:**
