# Creating Entity Types {#creating-entity-types}

Creating a new Entity Type lets you define the shape of some new data you want to use in HASH.

1.  To create a new Entity Type: click the + button on the right of “TYPES” in the left side-bar, or click the + button in the top-nav and select “Create Entity Type”.

1.  Set a name and description for your Entity Type. The name and sometimes its description will appear in lists, so it’s a good idea to make it descriptive and specific so that you and your collaborators can recognize it in the future.

1.  Click ‘Create new entity type’ to proceed to the editor. Importantly, your new Entity Type is not yet saved. Navigating away from this screen will automatically discard your draft.

1.  Click ‘Add a property type +’ to define the properties your new Entity Type’s entities can have. The Property Type window will suggest some existing Property Types you may wish to use. These are shared public Property Types. Using public Property Types can save you time and will lead to your data conforming to shared standards and definitions more closely.

1.  Type to search or to name your new property. Typing will filter the suggested Property Types, allowing you to search through them. If there isn’t a public Property Type which you can use, type a name for your new Property Type and click “Create {name} PROPERTY TYPE”.

1.  Add a description. Your new Property Type will be available for other HASH users, like the suggested ones you just saw, so a generic description which could apply to other Entity Types will work best.

1.  Set a Data Type to define the expected values. Text, Number, and Boolean Data Types are default options, but you can also define Array and Property Object Data Types by clicking to “Specify a custom expected value”. Array Data Types are lists of primitive Data values, such as a list of Text values, while Property Object Data Types are sets of other Property Types, nested within the parent Property Type you are defining. These nested Property Types can themselves allow arrays of values and be required, explained below.

1.  Click ‘Save expected value’ if defining an Array or Property Object Data Type and then ‘Create new property type’. You will see your new Property Type in the Property Types table. You’ll notice that for each of these properties, you can also choose whether to allow arrays and whether the Property Type is required. Allowing arrays means that multiple Data values can be set for this Property Type. If the Data Type itself is defined as an array, this means that multiple arrays can be set as the Data value for this Property Type. Setting a Property Type to required means Entities of this Entity Type cannot be created unless they provide a value for this Property.

1.  Click ‘Add a link type’ to define a link which can be created between Entities of this Entity Type. Like with Property Types, the Link Type window will suggest shared public Link Types you may wish to use. If you select to create a new Link Type, you’ll also need to give it a name and description.

1.  Click “Create new link type”. Back in the Link Types table, you’ll notice that the Expected Entity Type field shows “\* Anything”. This means that links of this type can be created with Entities of any type.

1.  Click “\* Anything” in the Expected Entity Types field. You’ll now see a set of suggested Entity Types which you can use to constrain this Link Type. You can’t create a new Entity Type from this interface. If you want to constraint this Link Type to an Entity Type which doesn’t exist yet, you will need to create it separately first.

1.  Click “0 or more” under Allowed number of links back on the Link Type table. This field lets you define a minimum and maximum number of links of this Link Type.

1.  Once you have added all your Property and Link Types, click “Create” in the top right corner. Your new Entity Type is now saved. No Entities of this type exist yet—jump to the Creating Entities section to add some data.
