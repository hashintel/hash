# Creating Entities and Links {#creating-entities-and-links}

While Entity Types define schemas for kinds of things, Entities are those things. Like for Entity Types, HASH has a no-code Entity editor which you can use to create, inspect, and update Entities. The Entity editor is also where you create Links between Entities.

1.  There are two ways to start creating a new Entity:

    1.  Click the + button in the top-nav and select ‘Create Entity’. You will then need to select an Entity Type to use for this new Entity.

    1.  Navigate to the Entity Type for which you want to create new Entities by finding it in the left side-bar and then click ‘Create new entity’ on the right.

1.  You will now be editing a new draft Entity of this Entity Type, as shown by the blue banner.

1.  Use the Properties table to enter Data values for your new Entity. You will see the expected Data value in the “Expected type” column, but the input field will also constrain you to an acceptable value.

1.  Use the Links table to create links between this Entity and other Entities. You will see which Entity Types each Link Type allows in the “Expected entity type” column, but the Entity selection window which opens when you click to add a new link will be constrained to the accepted Entity Types.

1.  This selection window also gives you the option to create a new Entity of the expected type in order to link to it. Clicking on that option will open an Entity editor view in a new tab, allowing you to create the new Entity. Once the new Entity is created, it will not be automatically linked to the original Entity you were creating—you will need to use the Entity selection window to find it and create the link.

1.  Once you have added Properties and Links, click ‘Create entity’ to save your new Entity. Once saved, it will be available to link to other Entities and will appear on the Entities tab on its Entity Type page.
