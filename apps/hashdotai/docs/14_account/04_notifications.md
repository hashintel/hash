Notifications can be set at the user account level, helping control

You can receive notifications:

- inside of HASH ("in-app")
- via email
- via Slack
- via Discord
- and via one of SMS, WhatsApp or Telegram.

By default you will only ever receive notifications in-app and via email from HASH and you must explicitly opt-in from the "notifications" page of HASH, or while installing a plugin (e.g. the HASH Slack App) to receive notifications via any other method.
