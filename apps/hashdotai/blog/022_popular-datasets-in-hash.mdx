[HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/index) provides access to a large collection of user-uploaded datasets you can use to generate and power a simulation. Below are some of our favorite datasets:

- [Master List of LEGO Part Numbers](https://simulation.hash.ai/@peeron/parts): Master List of Official LEGO™ parts/numbers. Thousands of legos with descriptions of the parts. **Provider**: Peeron.
- [SARS-CoV-2 Superspreading Events](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/superspreading): A dataset with 1,100 SSEs - cases where at least five people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 - from around the world. **Provider**: Koen Swinkels.
- [Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)](https://simulation.hash.ai/@anon/cbeci): Metrics related to the Bitcoin Hashrate and electricity consumption for Bitcoin mining per country. **Provider**: Cambridge University.
- [Alcohol Consumption](https://simulation.hash.ai/@fivethirtyeight/alcohol-consumption): Country level information on the number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed. **Provider**: FiveThirtyEight.
- [AWS Instances](https://simulation.hash.ai/@hash/aws-instances): A dataset of EC2 instances offered through AWS. Includes the instance name, hourly rate, # of virtual CPUs, the memory, storage, & network performance. **Provider**: Amazon Web Services
- [Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://simulation.hash.ai/@berkeleyearth/surface-temperature): The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets. **Provider**: Berkeley University.
- [California Fires](https://simulation.hash.ai/@anon/ca-fires): A dataset of fire incidents in the state of California. **Provider**: California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention
- [FDA Product Recalls:](https://simulation.hash.ai/@us-fda/recalls) A compilation of FDA press releases regarding product recalls issued by companies from 2009 onwards. **Provider**: Food and Drug Administration
- [Anonymous Bank Call-Center Data](https://simulation.hash.ai/@technion/call-center-data): Call center data from a bank over a one year period. **Provider:** Technion University.
- [Northern Gannet Tracking Data - Bempton Breeding Birds](https://simulation.hash.ai/@royal-society-for-the-/northern_gannets): Migratory patterns of the Bempton Breeding Birds. GIS data that tracks the birds over a three year period. **Provider**: Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

To use these and other datasets in HASH, learn more about [using datasets in simulations](https://hash.dev/docs/simulations/creating-simulations/datasets) in the HASH docs, and explore an example of data being used in practice in the HASH [city infection model](https://simulation.hash.ai/index/5e863dcaeb2a7120ea2fe0b8/city-infection-model), where real-world housing data determines the location of houses and offices in a SEIR model.
