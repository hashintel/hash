## Changes to hCloud

HASH's [simulation cloud compute service](https://hash.ai/platform/cloud) will be moving to an on-demand model from Friday 5th May 2023. To use hCloud after this date you'll need a paid plan with HASH. [Contact us](https://hash.ai/contact) to learn more.

## And coming soon...

We've been "agent-based" programming since _day one_ of HASH in 2019, originally developing agents that ran in simulated environments... and more recently those that operate in the real-world as well. We'll be sharing more on these soon!
