## Permissions

**Authorization has now shipped in HASH.**

Pages can now be public as well as private, and permission to view, comment on, or edit pages can now be specified on a per-user or whole-web basis. This makes it easy to keep private data secret, and makes it easy to share information with both specific individuals and entire teams.

## Quick notes

One-click capture new information from anywhere in HASH (or the HASH Browser Extension, which will be available next month).

## Profile pages

Users and shared webs in HASH now have customizable profile pages. A new user-editable area allows blocks to be inserted onto a page, providing flexibility over what information appears; alongside an ability to pin types to the top of a profile page, making it easy for visitors to discover entities of highlighted types in your web.

## Open-source hCore

This month we also open-sourced hCore, our in-browser agent-based modeling IDE, in our experimental [`labs` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hashintel/labs). hCore's development has been frozen for some time, and we've now 100% open-sourced it to enable the community to take it forward. We've temporarily disabled the hosted version previously available at [core.hash.ai](https://core.hash.ai/), but we'll be reintroducing this with the ability for users to directly connect a GitHub account and load remote repositories containing simulations, replacing the version control capabilities found in [hIndex](https://hash.ai/platform/index). _All existing simulation models, agent behaviors and datasets published to hIndex will be migrated across to [HASH](http://hash.ai/platform/hash)._
