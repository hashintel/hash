## Organizations in HASH

Organizations, each with their own shared web (our new name for graphs/workspaces), can now be created by any user in HASH.

For those self-hosting HASH, this new feature will soon be toggleable at the instance level, as we're aware that for some use-cases it may not always be desirable, or may lead to end-user confusion.

## Other minor improvements

We've made a range of minor improvements and bug fixes to the HASH app:

- When creating a new page, the text cursor now correctly always starts in the header, instead of the body.

- The header bar now correctly renders on canvas pages.

- The notice banner on archived pages now includes information about the archiver and datetime of archival.

- Manually loading entities into blocks was broken. It now works again as expected.

- Incomplete/aborted sign-ups to the app are now handled better.

- Creating, editing and resolving comments on pages should be several times faster.

- The wider HASH application should also be significantly faster.

We've also introduced RSS (and Atom, can you believe!) feeds onto the [HASH Developer Blog](https://hash.dev/blog). We have some big news planned for the months ahead...

## Public roadmap

We've published a roadmap page at [hash.dev/roadmap](https://hash.dev/roadmap) which includes a "tech tree" showing what's new and outstanding in HASH. It's designed for developers, so includes some technical language, but gives a rough sense as to the features coming up, and which ones contribute towards different uses of HASH. A lot of our recent work has been "under the hood", and hasn't (yet) translated into user-facing features. We hope this shines some light on why, and excites you as much as it does us.
