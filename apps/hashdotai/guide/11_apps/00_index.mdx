# Introduction

**Apps** are ready-made bundles of blocks, types and pages, which can be added to a web with one click. They work with data that already exists inside your web, without it ever leaving your system, providing you with secure, out-the-box access to workflows, tools and functionality that historically would only have been accessible in standalone applications (e.g. an external CRM, ATS, or ERP system).
