# Creating a new property type

To create a new property type, open the entity type editor page of the entity type you wish to add the property type to.

If you're creating a new property type, you'll be asked now to provide a description. Your new property type will then become available for wider use in HASH, like the suggested ones you just saw, so a generic description which could apply to other entity types will work best.

Set a [data type](/guide/types/data-types) that defines the allowed values of a property type. Data types may be primtive, such as `Text`, `Number`, or `Boolean` (true/false), as well as more complex (`Phone Number`) or specific (e.g. various units of length). You can also define `Array` and `Property Object` data types by clicking “**Specify a custom expected value**”.
- `Array` data types are lists of values, such as a list of `Text` values
- `Property Object` data types are sets of other property types, nested within the _parent_ property type you are defining.
- Most users will never need to use these, and in many cases an object of property types would be better created as a separate entity with its own type that is then linked to other entities as required.

Click ‘Save expected value’ if defining an Array or Property Object Data Type and then ‘Create new property type’. You will see your new Property Type in the Property Types table. You’ll notice that for each of these properties, you can also choose whether this entity type _requires_ this property and whether it accepts _multiple_ of the property type's expected value. Setting a Property Type to required means Entities of this Entity Type cannot be created unless they provide a value for this Property. Allowing multiple of the expected property type's value means that whatever the expected value is, there can be multiple of them (i.e. a list or array). If the property type expects a number, allowing multiple means the entity type will expect a list of numbers, and if the property type expects a list of numbers, allowing multiple would mean that the entity expects _a list of list of numbers_.
