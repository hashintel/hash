# Overview

**Data types** describe an acceptable format of a value. Data types (validation logic) are distinct from property types (semantic meaning), allowing for single data types to be re-used across many multiple property types.

# Primtive data types

HASH contains a series of primitive data types, which are widely used, and from which more complex data types can be constructed. These include:

- `Text`: an ordered sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols
- `Number`: an arithmetical value (in the [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) system)
- `Boolean`: a "true" or "false" value

HASH also contains three other primitive data types, which are unlikely to be useful to most users.

The following primtive data types are also supported in HASH, ensuring that all values representable within JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are also representable in HASH:

- `Null`: A placeholder value representing 'nothing'
- `Object`: A plain JSON object with no predefined structure
- `Empty List`: An empty List

# Custom data types

Non-primitive (i.e. "custom") data types provide an easy way to validate more complicated property values which historically might have required the repeated writing or rewriting or Regular Expressions (RegEx), or use of purpose-built programming language data validation libraries -- for example credit card numbers, dates, phone numbers, colors, etc.
