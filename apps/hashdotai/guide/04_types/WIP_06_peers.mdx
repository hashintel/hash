Peers of a type or entity are other types and entities which refer to the same "thing".

Types and entities may be considered "the same" as one another in a few different ways:

1. **Semantic** sameness: two or more types may refer to the same concept, and two or more entities refer to the same subject
1. **Structural** sameness: multiple types or multiple entities may expect the exact same attributes (properties and links)
1. **Complete** sameness: types and entities may be _both_ semantically _and_ structurally identical

# Semantic sameness

## Types

Types are said to be semantically identically when they refer to the same type of thing.

Two types which refer to the same concept, or thing, are not necessarily guaranteed to define the exact same set of expected attributes. For example, let's assume two different people create a `Dog` type in HASH.

The first `Dog` type creator is a vetinarian. They care about certain characteristics of the dog such as its `Name`, `Age`, `Weight`, and `Medical History`.

The second `Dog` type creator is a dogwalker. Like the veterinarian, they care about the dog's `Name`, but they also want to know its `Favorite Toy`. Conversely, its `Weight` doesn't matter.

Both the veterinarian and the dogwalker have created types that unmistakably refer to the same real-world concept, a dog, but have specified different expected attributes, reflecting those characteristics that are important to them.

## Entities

Any number of entities may refer to the same exact subject, but are not guaranteed to use the same types or attributes to describe it.

# Structural sameness

## Types

When two types are literally identical in terms of the attributes (properties and links) they define as expected, we say that they are "structurally" the same as each other.

In the real world, semantically different concepts are _never_ "structurally the same". But when concepts are represented in abstract form, they may often appear to be structurally similar or identical.

For example, consider two different user's simplified entity type definitions. One defines "Automobile Repair Shop" and another defines "General Practice Surgery". Neither user has added much specialized information to these entity types, creating them quickly for purposes unknown to us. Both entity types outline the exact same set of expected property types:

- Opening Time
- Closing Time
- Address
- Telephone Number
- Website

Although an `Automobile Repair Shop` and a `General Practice Surgery` are clearly semantically different things, in this case their type definitions are structurally identical.

## Entities

Different entities may be structurally the same as each other if they are of the exact same type(s), and their attribute values are identical. For example, two `Person` entities may both share the same `Preferred Name` and `Date of Birth`, with no other data present, appearing structurally identical to each other. However, we might know that they are not in fact semantically the same (i.e. duplicates of one another), but in fact refer to two different people.

# Complete sameness

## Types

If two types are both semantically and structurally identical, such as when a type is duplicated in HASH, or recreated exactly, they are said to be "completely" the same.

## Entities

If two entities are both semantically and structurally identical, they can also be said to be "completely" the same, or "duplicates" of one another. Where the same sources of information -- for example a scraped webpage, or imported file -- are ingested by many users, it is not uncommon to find such duplicate entities across multiple webs.

# Crosswalking

## What is Crosswalking

Crosswalking is the attempt to identify, and subsequently link, both types and entities which refer to the same semantic thing.

## Automatic Crosswalking

We plan on introducing tooling to assist in the automatic crosswalking of types and entities. In the meantime, you can read about some of the challenges in doing so below.

Challenges in automatically crosswalking types:

- Structural sameness does not imply semantic similarity: two types which expect the exact same attributes may be _more likely_ to be the same as one another, but they do not _necessarily_ refer to the same thing.
- Semantic sameness is not the same as semantic similarity: two types may be extremely similar, while one or both of creators perceive some nuance or difference between them. For example:
  - Two people may create `Artwork` types, but disagree with each other on what kinds of things qualify as `Artwork`. These types may even be structurally the same as one another, but still semantically differentiated in subtle, hard-to-ascertain ways.
  - Two businesses may create `Staff Member` types. One may include temporary workers and contractors in this definition (producing a 'total headcount'), while another may exclude them as they may not legally qualify as "employees".

Challenges in automatically crosswalking entities:

- Semantically identical entities may not share an exact type. For example, people may use different `Politician` types to refer to `Barack Obama`, while meaning the same person.
- Semantically identical entities may exist without even having the same semantic types declared on them in the first place. For example, the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) might not bother to assert that `Barack Obama` has a `Politician` type at all, instead assigning him the type of `Executive Producer` for his involvement in movies such as _American Symphony_. While this is not what most people will be primarily familiar with him as, the `Barack Obama` entity here is (in this example at least) semantically the same entity referred to by those using the `Politican` type.

In the meantime, you can explicitly define peer relationships between types and entities by following the instructions above.
