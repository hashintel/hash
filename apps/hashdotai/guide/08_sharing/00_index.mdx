# Introduction

By default, the information you create in your personal web is _private_. However, it's easy to publicly publish or selectively share any type or any entity (including pages) in HASH. This allows you to share some things with others, while controlling access to sensitive information.

# Shared webs<a id="#internally" />

The easiest way to collaborate with others in HASH is to create an [organization](/guide/webs/orgs), providing you with a 'shared web' accessible to all of its members. Learn more about [creating an org >](/guide/webs/orgs#create)

# Sharing directly with others<a id="#directly" />

You can also share individual entities (including pages) and types directly in HASH with other [users](/guide/webs/users), on a one-by-one basis; [orgs](/guide/webs/orgs), providing access to all of their members; and the public (granting unrestricted view permission to anybody who visits the page).

## Sharing pages<a id="#pages" />

The process for sharing [pages](/guide/pages) is straight-forward. Simply click the "Share" button in the top-right of each page, directly beneath the navbar, and specify which peopole should have what level of access.

When you make a page visible to others, you also provide the ability to view all of the blocks on a page, as well.

However, linked entities referenced in blocks must be shared separately. For example, if your page contains a table of people, which are private within your web, externals viewers of the page won't be able to see the entities in your table, unless you make these public, or otherwise share access to them, as well.

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  We'll be introducing improved controls for sharing pages in the future,
  allowing for easier sharing of linked entities, and previewing of the exact
  data that other users can see.
</Callout>

## Sharing entities<a id="#entities" />

The process for sharing [entities](/guide/entities) in similar to that described for [sharing pages](#pages) (above). Simply click the "Share" button in the top-right corner of any entity's page.

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  In the future, when sharing an entity, you'll be advised if it has any linked
  entities, and asked if you want to share these, too.
</Callout>

## Sharing types<a id="#types" />

Currently in HASH, all [types](/guide/types) are public.

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  In an upcoming update, we'll be allowing types to be "unlisted", making them
  discoverable only by others with the URL. Further down the line, **Plus**,
  **Team** and **Ultra** users will be able to create fully private types.
</Callout>

## Sharing flows

Currently in HASH, all [flows](/guide/flows) are private to members of the web they belong to. This means that only you will be able to see flows in your [personal web](/guide/webs#personal-webs), and only the members of a [shared web](/guide/webs#shared-webs) will be able tosee the flows within it.

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  In an upcoming update, we'll allow flows to be "published", as well as shared
  directly with specific users outside of the web in which they reside.
</Callout>
