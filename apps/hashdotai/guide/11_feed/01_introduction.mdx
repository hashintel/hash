# Coming Soon

**Feeds** contain updates from people you are connected to on HASH. Your feed helps surface information you care about, and is powered by an open algorithm. You can choose what algorithm is used to populate your feed, and switch between modes at any point in time (e.g. "distract me", "help me focus", "improve my mood", etc.)

Feeds contain information posted by people directly to HASH, and in the future will contain support for updates posted by people in your network to certain other sites (namely those which support the ActivityPub protocol, e.g.: Threads from Instagram, Mastodon). Further down the line we intend to introduce support for incorporating updates from additional social networks, as well (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram; subject to legal and technical constraints).

Feeds are coming soon to HASH. To register for early-access, fill in your email address below.
