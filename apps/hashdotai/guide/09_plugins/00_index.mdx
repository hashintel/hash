# What are plugins?

**Plugins provide access to HASH from inside of other applications.** For example, the HASH [browser extension](#browsers) allows you to add HASH to your favorite web browser, automatically inferring entities from the web-pages you visit, and allowing you to clip information from around the web as you go (easily adding it to your HASH web).
