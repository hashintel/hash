# Introduction

HASH contains a lot of features and functionality, but it's easy to learn and get started with. You can start using HASH for one simple thing, and discover additional capabilities and functionality as you go.

# 1. Create an account

Using the hosted version of HASH at [hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/) is the fastest way to get started. Create an account over on the [Sign Up](/signup) page and follow the on-screen instructions to get onboarded.

When creating a user account, you'll need to choose an **account name**, under which your profile will be visible (e.g. [hash.ai/@example](https://app.hash.ai/@example)).

<Toggle title="Tips for choosing a good account name">

- **DO choose an account name that...**

  1. is unique, easily recognizable, and memorable — think of your account name as your brand;
  1. is pronounceable — make it easy for yourself to share your account name with other people in the future;
  1. may be consistent with the "username" or "handle" you already use elsewhere (e.g. on social media sites) — help friends find you more easily.

- **DON'T choose an account name that...**
  1. is potentially embarrassing, e.g. a joke that won't be funny later;
  1. relates to your current employer, as account names cannot be changed;
  1. exposes personal information you don't intend (such as your email address);
  1. incorporates someone else's brand name or trademark in a way that may cause confusion.

# 2. Install the browser extension

We strongly recommend installing the [HASH browser extension](/integrations#plugins). Doing so will provide you with access to additional capabilities, including the ability to create and run more powerful [flows](/guide/flows), in HASH.

# 3. Use the app<a id="#navigate" />

## Navigation

The HASH interface is made up of three main panels:

1. The **top navigation** (aka. "navbar"), where you’ll see the HASH logo, search bar, and buttons in the top-right for capturing new information in HASH, viewing notifications and actions, and managing your account. In the very top-right of the page is your avatar. You can click this to open up a settings menu from anywhere in HASH.
1. The **left-hand sidebar**, where you’ll find links to HASH's main features, as well as each of your [webs](/guide/webs) and the [pages](/guide/pages) they contain, along with the [types](/guide/types) you use, and anything you've pinned.
1. The **main panel**, where the primary information in HASH is shown.

## Picking a use case

If you have a specific [use case](/guide/introduction/use-cases) that you'd like to use HASH for, follow the relevant tutorial to get started.

## Syncing your information

Whether or not you have a particular use case in mind, we recommend that you start off using HASH with your existing files and digital information, rather than trying to figure out HASH's functionality in the context of an empty workspace. To connect a service you already use, [set up an integration](/guide/integrations).
