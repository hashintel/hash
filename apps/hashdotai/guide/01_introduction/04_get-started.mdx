# Introduction

HASH contains a lot of features and functionality, but it's easy to learn and get started with. You can start using HASH for one simple thing, and discover additional capabilities and functionality as you go.

# 1. Create an account

Create an account at [hash.ai/signup](https://app.hash.ai/signup) by clicking the link and following the on-screen instructions.

When creating a user account, you'll need to choose an **account name**, at which your profile will be visible (e.g. [hash.ai/example](https://hash.ai/@example)).

**Tips for choosing a good account name**

- **A good account name:**
  1. is unique, easily recognizable, and memorable — think of your account name as your brand;
  1. is pronounceable — make it easy for yourself to share your account name with other people in the future;
  1. may be consistent with the "username" or "handle" you already use elsewhere (e.g. on social media sites) — help friends find you more easily.
- **Avoid choosing an account name that:**
  1. is potentially embarrassing, e.g. a joke that won't be funny later;
  1. relates to your current employer, as account names cannot be changed;
  1. exposes personal information you don't intend (such as your email address);
  1. incorporates someone else's brand name or trademark in a way that may cause confusion.

# 2. Install the Browser Extension

We strongly recommend installing the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins). Doing so will provide you with access to

# 3. Use the app<a id="#navigate" />

The HASH interface is made up of three main panels:

1. The **top-nav**, where you’ll see the workspace switcher and options to create new Pages, Entity Types, and Entities.
1. The **left side-bar**, where you’ll find your account options alongside panels for managing Pages and Types.
1. The **center pane**, where Types, Entities, Pages, and Blocks are viewed and manipulated.

## Top Navigation<a id="#topnav" />

The top navigation bar contains the HASH logo and a searchbar on the left, as well a number of icons. In the very top-right of the page is your avatar. You can click this to open up a settings menu from anywhere in HASH. Next to it you'll find a "Notifications" icon and counter, which alerts you to new notifications.

## Sidebar

At the top of the sidebar you'll see quick links to some of the most frequently-visited parts of HASH:

You'll also see a page tree, containing the pages you create in HASH (as well as those created by others in any shared organizations you're a member), as well as a section called "Types". You'll be able to add your own additional sections later.

## Inbox

Your inbox contains [notifications], [messages], and [actions] (including drafts).

## Notes

You can access "quick notes" at any time.

# Alternative: Self-host HASH

An alternative to using the hosted version of HASH is to self-host your own instance of HASH. This requires a degree of technical knowldege and is only recommended for advanced users.

If you're trying HASH out, or using it for the first time, we recommend following the instructions above, rather than self-hosting HASH. If, however, you're techically minded, and comfortable hosting your own web services, you can follow the instructions contained on the [HASH developer documentation](https://hash.dev/docs) website for a quickstart guide to self-hosting HASH.

Because HASH is open-source, whichever version of HASH you choose now, there's never any risk of vendor lock-in, and you can decide or switch between using the hosted and self-hosted versions at any time.





# How can I access HASH?

## Website

The current version of HASH is designed to be accessed primarily via your web browser.

To access HASH, you'll first need to [log in](https://app.hash.ai/login) to a HASH account (or [create an account](https://app.hash.ai/signup) if you don't already have one). Once onboarded and inside, you'll see a homepage that looks like this...

SCREENSHOT!!!

From here, you'll be able to use HASH. Check out our [Get Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) for more.

You can access this user guide as well as our community of users by clicking the "Help & Support" button in the bottom-left of HASH at any time.

## Browser Extension

In addition to accessing HASH via its web interface, you can use the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins) within all major web browsers (including Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox).

The HASH browser extension:

- **lets you quickly access common actions and key features from anywhere:** e.g. create a new entities
- **provides additional context or information when taking actions:** e.g. optionally embed a snapshot of the current open page when creating a new entity
- **unlocks new capabilities:** e.g. when enabled, the extension can privately and securely observe your browsing activity, in order to automatically suggest new entities for your [personal HASH web](https://hash.ai/guide/webs). This lets you add new information to your web with zero typing or manual data entry - for example, people, products, or events mentioned on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook, in news articles, or on any other website you visit.

## Other Plugins

A number of other HASH plugins are currently being considered for development. Please visit the [plugin directory](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins) to cast your vote for which we should build next.
