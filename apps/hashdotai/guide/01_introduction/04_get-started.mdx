# Introduction

HASH contains a lot of features and functionality, but it's easy to learn and get started with. You can start using HASH for one simple thing, and discover additional capabilities and functionality as you go.

# Create an account

Using the hosted version of HASH at [hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/) is the fastest way to get started. Create an account over on the [Sign Up](https://app.hash.ai/signup) page and follow the on-screen instructions to get onboarded.

When creating a user account, you'll need to choose an **account name**, at which your profile will be visible (e.g. [hash.ai/example](https://hash.ai/@example)).

**Tips for choosing a good account name**

- **A good account name:**
  1. is unique, easily recognizable, and memorable — think of your account name as your brand;
  1. is pronounceable — make it easy for yourself to share your account name with other people in the future;
  1. may be consistent with the "username" or "handle" you already use elsewhere (e.g. on social media sites) — help friends find you more easily.
- **Avoid choosing an account name that:**
  1. is potentially embarrassing, e.g. a joke that won't be funny later;
  1. relates to your current employer, as account names cannot be changed;
  1. exposes personal information you don't intend (such as your email address);
  1. incorporates someone else's brand name or trademark in a way that may cause confusion.

# Finding your way around<a id="#navigate" />

The HASH interface is made up of three main panels:

1. The **top-nav**, where you’ll see the workspace switcher and options to create new Pages, Entity Types, and Entities.
1. The **left side-bar**, where you’ll find your account options alongside panels for managing Pages and Types.
1. The **center pane**, where Types, Entities, Pages, and Blocks are viewed and manipulated.

## Top Nav<a id="#topnav" />

The top navigation contains the 'HASH' logo (click this to go home, )

## Sidebar

At the top of the sidebar you'll see quick links to some of the most frequently-visited parts of HASH:

- Inbox
- Notes
- Flows
- AI

You'll also see a page tree, containing the pages you create in HASH (as well as those created by others in any shared organizations you're a member), as well as a section called "Types". You'll be able to add your own additional sections later.

## Inbox

Your inbox contains [notifications], [messages], and [actions] (including drafts).

## Quick note

# Browser Extension

We strongly recommend installing the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins). Doing so will provide you with access to

# Self-hosting HASH

An alternative to using the hosted version of HASH is to self-host your own instance of HASH. This requires a degree of technical knowldege and is only recommended for advanced users.

If you're trying HASH out, or using it for the first time, we recommend following the instructions above, rather than self-hosting HASH. If, however, you're techically minded, and comfortable hosting your own web services, you can follow the instructions contained on the [HASH developer documentation](https://hash.dev/docs) website for a quickstart guide to self-hosting HASH.

Because HASH is open-source, whichever version of HASH you choose now, there's never any risk of vendor lock-in, and you can decide or switch between using the hosted and self-hosted versions at any time.
