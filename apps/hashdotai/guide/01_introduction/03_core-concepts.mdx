# Overview

You don't need to understand all of the concepts outlined on this page in order to [Get Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) with HASH, but being familiar with them will help you learn HASH faster. We recommend having a quick scan of this page as you start out, and returning to it later when you need more information about a particular thing.

# Concepts

## Accounts

We use the term 'account' to refer to both **users** and **orgs** in HASH. All users and orgs have a _web_ and an _account name_, such as `@example`. This can be used to access an account's public profile, such as [hash.ai/@example](/@example).

## Webs

Every user and every org has their own [**web**](/guide/webs). Webs contain **entities** (data), as well as **types** (which define what entities are, and provide them with meaning).

User's webs are called [Personal Webs](/guide/webs/users#web), and orgs' webs are known as [Shared Webs](/guide/webs/orgs#web). Users may have access to any number of shared webs, in addition to their own personal one.

## Entities

Data in a [web](/guide/webs) exists in the form of [entities](/guide/entities). An individual entity may have one or more [entity types](/guide/types/entity-types), which in turn specify the [**attributes**](/guide/entities/attributes) that can be associated with it. No information can be stored about an entity until it has a type.

## Attributes

[Attributes](/guide/entities/attributes) are information about entities. They can either be [properties](/guide/entities/attributes#properties) (values) representing some characteristic of an entity, or [links](/guide/entities/attributes#links) (relationships) connecting one entity to another.

## Types

Depending on how you use HASH, you may never need to create your own [**types**](/guide/types) or _really_ learn how they work. However, in short, there are four kinds of [types](/guide/types) in HASH.

[Entities](/guide/entities) are described by [entity types](/guide/types/entity-types), which define what sort of thing(s) an entity is, and the kinds of information (attributes) that can be associated with it.

[Attributes](/guide/entities/attributes) come in the form of [properties](/guide/entities/attributes#properties) (values) and [links](/guide/entities/attributes#links) (pointers to other entities):

- Properties tell you something about the entity itself, for example its name. They are described by a [property type](/guide/types/property-types) that provides semantic meaning, and specifies the expected [data type(s)](/guide/types/data-types), e.g. `Text` or `Date`.
- Links describe the relationship between entities (e.g. two people, or a person and a company). They are described by [link types](/guide/types/link-types), and may themselves have properties that tell you something about the relationship. For example, an employment relationship may have a job title and a start date.

These four types (entity, link, property and data) are known collectively as our "type system", enable any kind of data to be represented in HASH, and they are part of what makes HASH so powerful.

## Permissions

[**Permissions**](/guide/webs/permissions) govern what users (both individually and on a group-basis) can both see and do. Permissions can be managed very granularly, allowing view, update, comment, share and other forms of access to be restricted only to authorized users.

## History

[History](/guide/webs/history) in HASH refers to three things:

1. a complete record of all the changes to an entity or type over time (change tracking)
1. the ability to inspect, access and even use older versions of an entity or type (versioning)
1. the ability to see where information and changes came from, as well as what caused them (provenance)

## Pages

[Pages](/guide/pages) provide a way of using your entities, in HASH. Pages are created inside of each web you belong to (i.e. your own personal web, or the shared web of any organizations you're a member of), and will appear in your left-hand sidebar inside of HASH.

There are two types of pages in HASH:

- [Documents](/guide/pages/documents): linear pages where blocks are arranged in columns; typically used for text-heavy pages
- [Canvases](/guide/pages/canvases): free-form pages where blocks can be arranged spatially on an infinite canvas; useful for mindmaps, flowcharts, dashboards, and app-building

## Blocks

[Blocks](/guide/pages/blocks) can be inserted into pages, and provide many different kinds of functionality. For example:

- the **Paragaph** block lets you type (or see) some text, depending on whether you have edit (or just view) permissions on a page
- the **Image** block similarly lets you edit, insert, or simply view a picture (depending again upon your permissions)
- the **AI Image** block lets you type in a prompt and actually _generate_ an image, which is then saved and persisted on the page
- the **Minesweeper** block is just good fun

A block such as a button or dropdown may also be [interactive](/guide/pages/blocks#action), or offer complex functionality such as access to an AI chatbot.

If you're a web developer comfortable writing code, you can build and publish your own blocks, and use them inside of HASH, by following the guide in the [HASH developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs/blocks).
