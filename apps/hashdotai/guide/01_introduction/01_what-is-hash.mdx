# What is HASH?

HASH is a knowledge management and decision-making platform. It lets anybody capture information quickly and easily, directly within HASH, or ingest information from elsewhere. All of this data can then be worked with from within one place.

HASH two-way syncs information with its original sources to ensure your data is always up to date, wherever it's viewed from.

**HASH also lets you:**

- create [documents](/guide/pages/documents) that cleanly and reliably incorporate live or historical data
- build your own dashboards and custom views of data (atop [canvases](/guide/pages/canvases))
- create interfaces and [apps](/guide/apps) on top of data... with _or without_ writing code
- display, update and interact with information through [blocks](/guide/pages/blocks)
- set up automated ([flows](/guide/flows)) that perform actions or transform data: on a schedule, when specific are observed, or when manually triggered

# How can I use HASH?

HASH can be used for a great number of things. You can solve your own problems, or discover some of the use cases HASH has already helped solve for others by taking a look at the [Use Cases](https://hash.ai/guide/introduction/use-cases) page.

Whichever version of HASH you use, and whatever you use HASH for, your data is private by default. This means it is only visible to you, unless you explicitly choose to make it public.

# How can I access HASH?

## Website

The current version of HASH is designed to be accessed primarily via your web browser.

To access HASH, you'll first need to [log in](https://app.hash.ai/login) to a HASH account (or [create an account](https://app.hash.ai/signup) if you don't already have one). Once onboarded and inside, you'll see a homepage that looks like this...

From here, you'll be able to use HASH. Check out our [Get Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) for more.

You can access this user guide as well as our community of users by clicking the "Help & Support" button in the bottom-left of HASH at any time.

## Browser Extension

In addition to accessing HASH via its web interface, you can use the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins) within all major web browsers (including Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox).

The HASH browser extension:

- **lets you quickly access common actions and key features from anywhere:** e.g. create a new entities
- **provides additional context or information when taking actions:** e.g. optionally embed a snapshot of the current open page when creating a new entity
- **unlocks new capabilities:** e.g. when enabled, the extension can privately and securely observe your browsing activity, in order to automatically suggest new entities for your [personal HASH web](https://hash.ai/guide/webs). This lets you add new information to your web with zero typing or manual data entry - for example, people, products, or events mentioned on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook, in news articles, or on any other website you visit.
