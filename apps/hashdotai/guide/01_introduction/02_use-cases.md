# Using HASH

## Personal Use Cases {#examples}

## Group Use Cases

HASH supports a wide range of use cases, replacing other SaaS apps you may be paying for.

- **Employee Directory & Org Charts** â€” employee data can be structured in HASH and then rendered with blocks which present profile information.
- **Internal Dashboards** - information can be ingested into HASH from a variety of sources, and plotted/graphed/featured using chart and text blocks.
- **Event Countdown** - 
- **Membership Group Coordination** - 

## Developer Use Cases

HASH is usable as a high-performance, flexible datastore and backend for separately developed applications. To learn more about using HASH as a datastore or backend, 

HASH's API is both publicly accessible, and easy to develop web, mobile and other applications around. HASH provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on top of your data, through its [type](https://hash.ai/guide/types) and [entity](https://hash.ai/guide/entities) editors. Information in a HASH web can be protected with advanced rules, known as [permissions](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/permissions), so that access can be controlled and restricted to the right authorized users only, without improperly exposing user data, or risking inadvertent changes to live production data that should remain fixed. At the same time, information which you do want to be shared internally within your organization (or even externally, further afield) can be accessed within the HASH application itself.
