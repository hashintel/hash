Our [mission](/about/mission) is to help everybody make the right decision. But that doesn't just happen by having all of the right information. You also have to be able to use it.

Our vision for HASH is one of a truly **all-in-one workspace**, capable of not only integrating with — but also replacing — many different kinds of apps, and providing a unified view of all of an individual or organization's information, wherever it lives.

This means that in addition to what you can [currently do with HASH today](/guide/introduction), you'll also be able to:

- set up automations, called [flows](/guide/flows), that perform actions (such as sending an email, or triggering a notification) in response to specific events, on a schedule, or when manually triggered
- create [documents](/guide/pages/documents) which can embed live data, as well as static/point-in-time information
- build [tools, apps and other interfaces](/guide/apps) on top of the data in your web, with _or without_ writing code
- run large-scale agent-based simulations, using realtime data, to identify optimization opportunities and risks in systems

We've already invested significant resources in these areas, and will be incorporating their functionality into HASH in the upcoming period. In some cases, we've already deployed versions of these technologies in the real-world, for example in our work to help [optimize the initial rollout of COVID vaccines](https://hash.ai/cases/simulation).
