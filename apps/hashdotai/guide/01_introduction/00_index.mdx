# What is HASH?

HASH is a new kind of database. Operating in the background, HASH continuously extracts and integrates data from the outside world. This information is assembled into a private knowledge graph, called a "web", and can be used in a number of different ways.

Traditionally, knowledge graphs have been hard to bootstrap and maintain, while AI "research" tools (although fast) lack the ability to assure information's quality and provenance. HASH, in contrast, is suitable for real-world use in domains where data accuracy, integrity and trustworthiness are paramount (for example: in error-sensitive applications, when making potentially high-cost/high-risk decisions, and when operating within regulated industries).

# How can webs be used?

Once information is in your web, HASH lets you:

- view and explore data visually as a graph, or through tables
- construct dashboards and custom views of data, helping you analyze aggregate information
- see how information changes over time, viewing the "history" of entities
- [identify](/guide/webs/history) where information in a web came from, viewing the original source and/or claimants
- [export](/guide/integrations) information in a variety of formats, and sync it with other apps or databases
- [share](/guide/sharing) specific information of their choosing with others

Data in a HASH web can also be utilized by other applications, including LLMs, for whom HASH webs provide a strongly consistent world/domain model, enabling efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

# How do webs get built?

Filling a web with detailed, useful and trustworthy information is easy with HASH, in contrast to traditional knowledge graphs and AI assistants.

- **Automated research (AI):** provide topics, questions or tasks for AI workers to autonomously research on your behalf
- **Passive growth (AI):** [HASH's browser extension](/download) can automatically extract data you care about from the webpages you visit, and apps/service you use, automatically and in the background
- **By hand:** manually add information by hand using our powerful, easy-to-use interface
- **From existing sources:** integrate information from services, apps and databases you already use with one-click and easy importers

Keeping your web well-maintained and accurate is also effortlessly easy with HASH, with AI automations that support:

- Detecting and merging duplicate entities
- Identifying potentially outdated information, and seeking more up-to-date values
- Checking and cross-referencing information

# How can I use HASH?

You'll need to [create a free account](https://app.hash.ai/signup). You'll probably also want to install the [browser extension](/download). These steps and others are covered in the [Geting Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) guide.

As for _what_ you might use HASH for, this is covered in the upcoming [Use Cases](/guide/introduction/use-cases) section of the user guide, next.

<Toggle title="Alternative: self-hosting HASH">

An alternative to using the hosted version of HASH is to self-host your own instance of HASH. This requires a degree of technical knowldege and is only recommended for advanced users.

If you're trying HASH out, or using it for the first time, we recommend following the instructions above, rather than self-hosting HASH. However, should you be techically minded, and comfortable hosting your own web services (or interested in contributing to the HASH codebase), you can follow the [HASH developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs/get-started/setup#local-hash) quickstart guide to self-hosting HASH.

Because HASH is open-source, whichever version of HASH you choose now, there's no risk of lock-in, and you can decide or switch between using the hosted and self-hosted versions at any time.
