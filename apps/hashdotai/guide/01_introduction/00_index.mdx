# What is HASH?

HASH is a new kind of database, designed to be used by both individuals and organizations. It syncs with the apps you already use, and grows itself automatically as you use them, and browse the web.

In doing so, it builds a knowledge graph, or private "web", of information. All of this data can then be accessed, used and updated from one place.

# How can webs be used?

**HASH lets you:**

- sync information from your web to other apps and databases using [integrations](/guide/integrations)
- create [documents](/guide/pages/documents) that use live or historical data
- construct dashboards and custom views of data, atop free-form [canvases](/guide/pages/canvases)
- build interfaces and [apps](/guide/apps) on top of data... with _or without_ writing code
- set up automated [flows](/guide/flows) that perform actions or transform data (manually executable, calendar-schedulable, and conditionally triggerable upon events)

These capabilities combine to make HASH a truly _all-in-one_ workspace capable of integrating with — as well as replacing — many different kinds of apps.

# How can I use HASH?

You'll need a free account. You'll probably also want to install the browser extension. These steps and others are covered in the [Geting Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) guide.

As for _what_ you might use HASH for, this is covered in the upcoming [Use Cases](/guide/introduction/use-cases) section of the user guide, next.

<Toggle title="Alternative: self-hosting HASH">

An alternative to using the hosted version of HASH is to self-host your own instance of HASH. This requires a degree of technical knowldege and is only recommended for advanced users.

If you're trying HASH out, or using it for the first time, we recommend following the instructions above, rather than self-hosting HASH. However, should you be techically minded, and comfortable hosting your own web services (or interested in contributing to the HASH codebase), you can follow the [HASH developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs/get-started/setup#local-hash) quickstart guide to self-hosting HASH.

Because HASH is open-source, whichever version of HASH you choose now, there's no risk of lock-in, and you can decide or switch between using the hosted and self-hosted versions at any time.
