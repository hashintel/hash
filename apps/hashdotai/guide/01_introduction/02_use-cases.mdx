# Using HASH<a id="#examples" />

You can use HASH by yourself, with family, friends, or as part of a larger/more formal organization.

## Personal Use Cases<a id="#personal" />

- **Notes:** quick note-taking, ability to `@mention` entities as well as pages/other notes, `@insert` specific properties/values, and use any one of an ever-growing library of [blocks](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/blocks).
- **Contacts:** automatically create and flesh out records for people based on pages you visit while you browse (e.g. from news articles, and profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- **Databases:** self-organizing, self-growing databases containing any kind of thing that interests you (recipes, music, films, a particular kind of product, social media users of a certain kind who you want to follow, etc.)
