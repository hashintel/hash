# Using HASH<a id="#examples" />

You can use HASH by yourself, with family, friends, or as part of a larger/more formal organization.

## Personal Use Cases<a id="#personal" />

- **Notes:** quick note-taking, ability to `@mention` entities as well as pages/other notes, `@insert` specific properties/values, and use any one of an ever-growing library of [blocks](https://hash.ai/guide/pages/blocks).
- **Contacts:** automatically create and flesh out records for people based on pages you visit while you browse (e.g. from news articles, and profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- **Databases:** self-organizing, self-growing databases containing any kind of thing that interests you (recipes, music, films, a particular kind of product, social media users of a certain kind who you want to follow, etc.)

## Business Use Cases<a id="#group" />

### Self-Growing Knowledge Graph

As an auto-growing, self-checking knowledge graph, HASH helps with a wide range of business use cases:

- **Sales**: populate a CRM with leads matching parameters you define
- **Recruitment:** populate an ATS with qualified candidates
- **Competitive Research:** monitor competitor features and updates
- **Public Relations:** find new journalists and generate new pitch ideas

HASH can also be [queried in natural language](/guide/ai/chat), and connected to a [wide range](/guide/integrations) of external tools.

### Workflow Automation

[Flows](/guide/flows) allow automated sequences of steps to be actioned using HASH, and [AI workers](/guide/ai/workers) are capable of planning and executing new flows, with or without humans in the loop.

### Ontology Creation

HASH makes it easy to create and manage types with a best-in-class ontology builder and [type system](/guide/types), allowing your organization to formally describe the sorts of data it cares about, and map internal data assets to semantically meaningful representations of them in a graph.

## Developer Use Cases<a id="#dev" />

HASH is usable as a flexible datastore and backend for separately developed applications. To learn more about using HASH in this way, see the [HASH developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs).

# Future plans

We also intend to make HASH suitable for a wide range of other use-cases in the future, including:
- **Knowledge management and documents:** HASH's support for [block](/guides/pages/blocks)-based pages, combined with its internal representation of data as entities, makes it a powerful all-in-one workspace capable of replacing tools like _Notion_.
- **SaaS consolidation and internal tool-building:** HASH's support for no-code block-based toolbuilding, and its built-in semantic database, makes it an equally powerful but _more user-friendly_ replacement for tool-building software like _Retool_.
- **Agent-based simulation:** HASH was designed from the ground-up to support agent-based modeling. _Coming soon_
- **Data warehousing:** _Coming soon_
- **Business intelligence and dashboarding:** _Coming soon_
- **Website building:** _Coming soon_
- **As a graph-based backend:** _Coming soon_

# Limits to using HASH

Many people use HASH for just one or two things to start with, and over time begin to use it for more. If you're unsure whether HASH is a good fit for a problem you're trying to solve, or if you're wondering how you might achieve something with HASH, [get in touch](/contact) with us.
