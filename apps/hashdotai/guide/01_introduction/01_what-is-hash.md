# Introduction

## What is HASH?

HASH is a knowledge management and decision-making platform. It lets anybody capture information quickly and easily, directly within HASH, or ingest information from elsewhere. All of this data can be worked within from within one place.

## What can I do with HASH?

HASH can be used for a great number of things. You can discover some of these over on the [use cases](https://hash.ai/guide/introduction/use-cases) page.

Whichever version of HASH you use, and whatever you use HASH for, your data is private by default. This means it is only visible to you, unless you explicitly choose to make it public.

## How can I access HASH?

HASH is primarily accessed via your web browser. To use it, you'll need to [log in](https://app.hash.ai/login) to a HASH account (or [create an account](https://app.hash.ai/signup) if you don't already have one). Once onboarded and inside, you'll see a homepage that looks like this...

SCREENSHOT!!!

From here, you'll be able to use HASH. You can access this user guide, and get other assistance by clicking the "Help & Support" button in the bottom-left of HASH at any time.

## Browser Extension

In addition to accessing HASH via its web interface, you can use the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins) to quickly access important key HASH features within all major web browsers (including Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox). The HASH browser extension:

- **makes it easy to perform common actions, quickly, from anywhere:** e.g. creating new entities
- **provides additional context or information when creating new entities:** e.g. optionally embed a snapshot of the current open page, or a highlighted section of text.
- **unlocks new capabilities:** e.g. when enabled, the extension can privately and securely observe your browsing activity, in order to automatically suggest new entities for your [personal HASH web](https://hash.ai/guide/webs). This lets you add new information to your web with zero typing or manual data entry - for example, people, products, or events mentioned on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook, in news articles, or on any other website you visit.
