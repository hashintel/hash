# Creating an account {go}

Using the hosted version of HASH at [hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/) is the fastest way to get started.


# Navigating the interface {#navigate}

The HASH interface is an all-in-one, browser-based, no-code workspace made up of three main panels:

1.  The **top-nav**, where you’ll see the workspace switcher and options to create new Pages, Entity Types, and Entities.
1.  The **left side-bar**, where you’ll find your account options alongside panels for managing Pages and Types.
1.  The **center pane**, where Types, Entities, Pages, and Blocks are viewed and manipulated.

## Top Nav {#topnav}

The top navigation contains the 'HASH' logo (click this to go home, )

## Sidebar {#sidebar}

At the top of the sidebar you'll see quick links to some of the most frequently-visited parts of HASH:

- Feed
- Inbox
- Drafts
- Quick note

You'll also see a page tree, containing the pages you create in HASH (as well as those created by others in any shared organizations you're a member), as well as a section called "Types". You'll be able to add your own additional sections later.

# Browser Extension

We strongly recommend installing the [HASH browser extension](https://hash.ai/integrations#plugins). Doing so will provide you with access to 

# Self-hosting HASH

An alternative to using the hosted version of HASH is to self-host your own instance of HASH. This requires a degree of technical knowldege and is only recommended for advanced users.

If you're trying HASH out, or using it for the first time, we recommend following the instructions above, rather than self-hosting HASH. If, however, you're techically minded, and comfortable hosting your own web services, you can follow the instructions contained on the [HASH developer documentation](https://hash.dev/docs) website for a quickstart guide to self-hosting HASH.

Because HASH is open-source, whichever version of HASH you choose now, there's never any risk of vendor lock-in, and you can decide or switch between using the hosted and self-hosted versions at any time.
