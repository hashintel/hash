# Working with data in Pages<a id="#working-with-data-in-pages" />

Pages let you render, manipulate, and create Entities and Links through Blocks. This section will introduce you to HASH’s Pages feature and walk you through common use cases for working with data in Blocks.

# Introduction to Pages

## Anatomy of a Page<a id="#anatomy-of-a-page" />

Pages are made up of several elements:

1. A **Title** and an **Emoji icon** (“Page Title” and the #️⃣ icon below). These serve to quickly explain what a Page is about and appear in the “PAGES” section in the left side-bar as well as in breadcrumbs at the very top of each. \

1. **Blocks** (demonstrated with the H1, Paragraph, Callout, and Code Blocks below). Every piece of content inside of a Page is a Block—a third-party component which can render and manipulate data. Blocks are laid out vertically and can be re-ordered. \

1. **Comments** (shown below on the right of the Paragraph Block). Comments are attached to Blocks and allow users to augment the content in Blocks with additional questions and thoughts.

## Organizing and navigating Pages<a id="#organizing-and-navigating-pages" />

You will find all of the Pages within your Workspace in the left side-bar under “PAGES”. Pages belong to the Workspace in which they were created and cannot be moved. You can drag and drop the Pages in the side-bar to reorder them.

## Creating a Page<a id="#creating-a-page" />

The + button next to “PAGES” lets you create a new Page. You can also create a new page using the + button in the top-nav. New Pages are added to the bottom of the Pages list in the left side-bar.

## Archiving a Page

You can archive a Page if you no longer need it by clicking the […] button to the right of its title in the side-bar and selecting “Archive page”. Archived pages do not appear in the side-bar and cannot be found through the UI but will still load if you have their URL. A banner at the top of an archived page makes it clear the page is archived.

## Subpages

Pages can have an unlimited number of subpages. In terms of features, subpages are identical to Pages, differing only in that they are nested under a parent Page in the left side-bar. A Page with subpages will have a chevron icon button on the left of its title in the side-bar. Clicking this icon will show or hide the list of subpages. When viewing a subpage, breadcrumbs at the very top of the page will show its parent Page or Pages.

## Sharing Pages in read-only mode

Pages in HASH are accessible to anyone with the link but only logged in users who are members of the Workspace which owns the page can edit it. To share a Page with a collaborator who is not a member of your Workspace, simply copy the URL from your browser’s address bar or click the [...] menu on the right of the Page’s title in the side-bar and select “Copy link to page”.

All pages within a web are stored in its page tree. However, just because a page appears in a tree, it doesn't mean that that page will be visible to everybody else with access to a web. The pages you see
