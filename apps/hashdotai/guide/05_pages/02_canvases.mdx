# Overview

Canvases are a kind of [page](/guide/pages) which allow you to insert and arrange blocks in any way you choose. With canvases you can drag and drop blocks spatially, in any way choose, along X/Y/Z axes: displaying them overlaid, in front or behind — or adjacently, side-by-side or atop — one another.

# Creating a canvas

Click the `+` button in the top-right of navigation bar, and select "Canvas". New canvases created from here will by default be added to your private web, unless you select another location at the point of creation.

# Ezample use cases

Use cases for canvases include:

- Dashboards
- Collaborative whiteboarding
- Tool-building: laying out blocks in more complicated or fluid layouts than allowed by [documents](/guide/pages/documents)
- Working with information spatially
