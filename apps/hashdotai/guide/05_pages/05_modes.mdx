# Overview

Depending on your [permissions](/guide/webs/permissions) within a [web](/guide/webs), you may or may not be able to take certain actions (including viewing, commenting, or editing) on a page.

# Types of modes

## "Edit" vs "view"

- **Editable:** a page is fully editable. Click inside a block to edit it.
- **Editable (locked):** even with edit permission on a page, you may find it has been "locked" to prevent its accidental editing. It is easy to lock and unlock a page (when you have the appropriate permission to do so), by clicking the "Lock"/"Unlock" button in a page's header, next to the "Share" button.
- **View only:** a page cannot be edited. Blocks will be selectable, but not editable. Certain blocks may be interactive, but changes will not be persisted for other users.

## Additional permissions

Additionally, you may have the following capabilities available to you on a page:

- **Comment:** you may be able to leave comments on a block, or with reference to a particular part of a page.
- **Suggest:** short of the ability to edit a page directly, you may have the ability to propose changes to a page (adding new information, or updating existing information).

# Previewing modes

Depending on your permissions, you may be able to toggle between different modes, to preview how a page looks to others.
