Depending on your [permissions](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/permissions) within a [web](https://hash.ai/guide/webs), you may or may not be able to take certain actions (including viewing, commenting, or editing) on a page.

You may be able to toggle between different modes, to preview how a page looks to others.

You may also be able to 'lock' a page, even when you have edit permission on it, to prevent yourself and others from accidentally editing it when you do not intend to.
