# Overview

Webs are collections of entities and types.

Every HASH account has its own web: all users have their own **personal web**, and all orgs a **shared web**.

An account's web is designed to represent its owner or member's understanding about the state of the world. The information within a web should provide an accurate, up-to-date reflection of facts, and act as a primary "source of truth" for its members.

Webs represent information as [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities).

Users can create or update entities in their web directly through the HASH user interface, or by connecting external applications and sources via the **integrations** menu.

## Personal webs<a id="#personal" />

Every HASH user has a "personal web" associated with their own webname.

Information you create is private by default, although it can be made public or shared with individual others.

## Shared webs<a id="#shared" />

Every organization has a "shared web".

Information created in a shared web is accessible to everyone who belongs to that organization by default, although it can be made public, shared with individual others, or conversely locked down more tightly, should its owner wish.

## HASH public web<a id="#public" />

The HASH public web consists of all of the public content from across all HASH user's webs. Private information is not included on the public web.

Currently, only the public content of [hash.ai] users is announced to and discoverable via the HASH public web, for use by other users when searching HASH, and via the HASH API. In the future we intend to allow for public information contained within self-hosted HASH instances to be connected to the HASH public web, as well.

## Relationship with the WWW<a id="#www" />

**How does the HASH public web relate to the World Wide Web (WWW)?** The HASH public web exists _on_ the WWW. Its contents are freely and publicly accessible by anybody.

However, while accessible via the WWW, the HASH public web is in contrast:

- highly strucutred, made up entirely of typed [entities](https://hash.ai/guide/entities), rather than unstructured text and multimedia
- permanent, with data generally available forever, except where its removal may be required by law and in limited other circumstances, bringing an end to unintentionally broken links
- inspectable, with version history and provenance persisted and made accessible
