# Overview

**Users** are individuals using HASH, like you. Every user in HASH should correspond to one human being in the "real world". Nobody is allowed to have more than one user account, and user accounts shouldn't be created to represent "machines", "agents", "organizations" or any other kind of non-human. This is a key condition of HASH's _Terms of Service_, and something we actively enforce. When you engage with other users on HASH, you should have confidence that they are real people.
