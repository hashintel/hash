Webs are collections of entities and types.

They can belong to individuals (personal webs) or groups (shared webs).

## Webs

Both **users** and **organizations** in [HASH] have their own _web_. An account's web acts as its canonical reference, or primary "source of truth" for representing the world around.

Webs contain [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities) conforming to a set of [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types) which define their [properties](https://hash.ai/glossary/properties).

Users can create or update entities in their web directly through the HASH user interface, or by connecting external applications or sources via the **integrations** menu.

Entities in webs can be easily accessed via the HASH API, and instantiated directly in simulations without data processing.

## Personal web

Every HASH user has a "personal web" associated with their own webname.

Information you create is private by default, although it can be made public or shared with individual others.

## Shared web

Shared webs (org webs)

## Public web
