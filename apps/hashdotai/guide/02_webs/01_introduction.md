# Webs

Webs are collections of entities and types. Every user has a **personal web**, and every org has a **shared web**.

## Webs

Both **users** and **organizations** in [HASH] have their own _web_. An account's web acts as its canonical reference, or primary "source of truth" for representing the world around.

Webs contain [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities) conforming to a set of [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types) which define their [properties](https://hash.ai/glossary/properties).

Users can create or update entities in their web directly through the HASH user interface, or by connecting external applications or sources via the **integrations** menu.

Entities in webs can be easily accessed via the HASH API, and instantiated directly in simulations without data processing.

## Personal webs {#personal}

Every HASH user has a "personal web" associated with their own webname.

Information you create is private by default, although it can be made public or shared with individual others.

## Shared webs {#shared}

Shared webs (org webs)

## HASH public web {#public}

The HASH public web consists of all of the public content from across all HASH user's webs. Private information is not included on the public web.

Currently, only public content of [hash.ai] users is announced to and discoverable via the HASH public web, for use by other users when searching HASH, and via the HASH API. In the future we intend to allow for public information contained within self-hosted HASH instances to be connected to the HASH public web, as well.

## Relationship with the WWW {#www}

**How does the HASH public web relate to the World Wide Web (WWW)?** The HASH public web exists _on_ the WWW. Its contents are freely and publicly accessible by anybody.

However, while accessible via the WWW, the HASH public web is in contrast:

- highly strucutred, made up entirely of typed [entities](https://hash.ai/guide/entities), rather than unstructured text and multimedia
- permanent, with data generally available forever, except where its removal may be required by law and in limited other circumstances, bringing an end to unintentionally broken links
- inspectable, with version history and provenance persisted and made accessible
