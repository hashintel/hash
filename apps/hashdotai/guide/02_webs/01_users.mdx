# Overview

**Users** are individuals using HASH, like you. Every user in HASH should correspond to one human being in the "real world". Nobody is allowed to have more than one user account, and user accounts shouldn't be created to represent "machines", "agents", "organizations" or any other kind of non-human. This is a key condition of HASH's _Terms of Service_, and something we actively enforce. When you engage with other users on HASH, you should have confidence that they are real people.

## User profiles<a id="#profile" />

When using HASH, you'll be able to see other users' public profiles. You'll also have your own profile, where you can choose what to make public. [Learn more >](/guide/account/profile)

Each user account belongs to a single _individual_.

## Personal webs<a id="#web" />

Every user has their own personal web. This is, by default, a private space.

## Interacting with other users<a id="#interact" />

### Mentioning users<a id="#mention" />

You can "mention" another user of HASH in the same way you might `@` mention any other entity (read more about [mentioning entities](/guide/pages/chips#entity-chips)).

To mention a user, simple type the `@` key while in a text block, and select the relevant user from the dropdown list of options that appears. You can carry on typing to refine your search, including to discover users you haven't interacted with before, or who exist outside of your own web(s).

If you mention another user of HASH, depending on their account settings, whether or not you've interacted with them before, and whether or not they can view the page you are mentioning them from, they may receive a notification that you have mentioned them, with a link back to the block/page containing the mention.

### Blocking users<a id="#block" />

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
