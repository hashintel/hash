# Overview

All billing in HASH is currently managed outside of the application itself. [Contact us](/contact?topic=billing) if you wish to change your billing details or modify any aspect of your subscription.

In the future, we'll be making both upgrade and cancelation flows available for self-service use via the user administration panel in HASH.
