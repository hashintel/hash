There are three types of accounts in HASH:

1. **[user] accounts**, each representing an individual human, with its own web (e.g. https://hash.ai/@d)
1. **[org] accounts**, each of which corresponds to a shared web (e.g. https://hash.ai/@soho) managed by one or more users
1. **[bot] accounts**, which perform automated actions in HASH

Your **user** account is unique to you. You should not share access with anybody else. Our terms of service state that you may only have one account at a time.
