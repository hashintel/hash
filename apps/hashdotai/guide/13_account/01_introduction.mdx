There are three types of accounts in HASH:
- [user] accounts, each representing an individual human, with its own web (e.g. https://hash.ai/@d)
- [org] accounts, each of which corresponds to a shared web (e.g. https://hash.ai/@soho)
- [bot] accounts, 

Your account is unique to you. You should not share access with anybody else. You may only have one account at a time.
