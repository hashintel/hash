# Your Account

Your **user account** is home to your own _private web_, and all of your personal information in HASH is stored within it.

You can manage your [security](/guide/account/security), [privacy](/guide/account/privacy), and [notification](/guide/account/notifications) settings from your [Account Settings](http://app.hash.ai/settings) page in HASH itself, as well as manage your [personalization](/guide/account/personalization) and [billing](/guide/account/billing) preferences.

All users of HASH, including free users, can also [get support](/guide/account/support) at any time.

# Types of Accounts

There are three types of accounts in HASH:

1. **[user](#users) accounts**, each representing an individual human, with its own web (e.g. [hash.ai/@d](https://app.hash.ai/@d))
1. **[org](#orgs) accounts**, each of which corresponds to a shared web (e.g. [hash.ai/@soho](https://app.hash.ai/@soho)) managed by one or more users
1. **[bot](#bots) accounts**, which perform automated actions in HASH

## Users

### Uniqueness

Your **user** account is used to uniquely identify you. You should not share access to it with anybody else.

Our [terms](/legal/terms) state that you may only have **one** user account at a time, so you should not have an "additional" or separate login.

If you want to collaborate with other users, you should use HASH's [sharing](/guide/sharing) functionality, or create an [org](/guide/webs/orgs) with its own shared web.

### Upgrading a user account

User accounts can either be **Free** or **Plus**. You can find out more and upgrade on the [pricing](/pricing) page.

### Canceling a user account

You can cancel your account and delete all of your information at any time by getting in touch with us via the [contact](/contact) form. Requests for deletion are processed promptly. If you'd simply like to take a break, you can also let us know, and we'll disable your account (preserving your information) until you're ready to return.

## Orgs

You can create an **org** account at any time by following the instructions on the [orgs](/guide/webs/org) page in the user guide.

All org accounts are owned by _at least_ one user. The administrator(s) of an org can choose to provision paid **Team** or **Ultra** seats for the members of their org. More information and the ability to upgrade can be found on the [pricing](/pricing) page.

## Bots

**Bot** accounts are machine-operated accounts which cannot be logged into directly. They perform system functions and automated actions in HASH. For now, the only bots you'll see as you use HASH are built-in ones, such as the `HASH AI` bot. In the future, we'll document how technical users familiar with programming can create their own bots for HASH, as part of our [developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs).
