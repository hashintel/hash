# Overview

**Waits** allow you to pause a flow's execution mid-run until a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) is satisfied.

You can use wait steps in combination with triggers to:

- pause a flow for a predetermined fixed amount of time;
- watch for and await a user response, enabling "human in the loop" workflows;
- watch for and await an AI agent or software system's action;
- watch for and await an external party's action.

# Example use cases

- **Public Consultation** — provide a time-limited window for members of the public to respond to a consultation document published online, before continuing with the next step in a flow. (Pausing a flow for a specific fixed length of time)
- **Quality Control** — introduce a human quality control, or "review" step in a workflow, whose further running is paused until approval is received. (Human-in-the-loop workflow)
- **Long-Running AI Workflows** — submit requests to an external LLM-provider like OpenAI or AI agent orchestor (like LlamaIndex or LangChain) and pause until a response is received, with no timeouts, even on incredibly long-running jobs. (Watch and wait for AI action or API trigger)
- **Outbound Email Campaigns** - send messages, and pause for a fixed amount of time before continuing, unless/until a prospect responds. (Watch and wait for a human response; combines well with [filters](/guide/flows/filters))
