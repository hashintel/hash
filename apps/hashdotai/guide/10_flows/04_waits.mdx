# Overview

**Waits** allow you to pause a flow's execution mid-run until a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) is satisfied.

You can use the wait step in combination with triggers to:

- pause for a set amount of time;
- await a user response (enabling "human in the loop" workflows);
- await an external AI agent or software system's action.
