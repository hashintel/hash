# Overview

**Flows** are sequences of steps which can be mapped out within HASH, and executed by HASH on your behalf.

# Steps

Flows consist of different kinds of steps:

- [Triggers](/guide/flows/triggers) which
- [Actions](/guide/flows/actions) which
- [Filters](/guide/flows/filters) which
- [Waits](/guide/flows/waits) allow you to pause flows until a trigger is satisfied

# Runs

- **One-off:** flows can be run upon creation, and subsequently re-run manually or "ad hoc" by a user, as required, from their [Flows](https://app.hash.ai/flows) page in HASH;
- **Automatic:** flows can also be run without user input, on autopilot, by satisfying a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) present within a flow;
- **Programmatic:** flows can be triggered by external software or function-calling agents using the [HASH API](https://hash.dev/docs/flows/api).

# Permissions

You can control the conditions under which flows can be run by using [filters](/guide/flows/filters).
