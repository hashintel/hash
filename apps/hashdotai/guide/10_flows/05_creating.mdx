You can provide an [AI Worker](/guide/ai/workers) with a goal in natural language, and it will "translate" this into a [flow](/guide/glows).

Alternatively, you can manually create your own flows in HASH.

# Creating a flow with AI

Click the "AI" tab in the left-hand sidebar of HASH, and make sure you're on the "Worker" page. Enter your goal into the form provided, and follow the on-screen instructions.

# Creating a flow manually

Click the `+` icon in the navbar, located in the top-right corner of HASH, and select "Flow" from the dropdown list of options.

To start, you'll need at least one [action](/guide/flows/actions) step. Actions are the things that a flow actually "does", and define the effect it has when run.

Optionally, you might also choose to specify a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers), and use [filter](/guide/flows/filters) or [wait](/guide/flows/waits) steps, depending on the process you're automating.
