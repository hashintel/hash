# Overview

**Filters** allow you to use conditional logic in [flows](/guide/flows), enabling branching execution paths and more powerful single runs.

# Example use cases

- **Quality scoring.** If a value returned is lower than a specific quality threshold or score, take a less resource-intensive approach to outreach.
- **Response optimization.** If a subject responds in a particular way to an earlier action, pursue one action. Otherwise, pursue the other.
- **Robust workflows.** If something fails, try again.
