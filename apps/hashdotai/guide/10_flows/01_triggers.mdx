# Overview

**Triggers** can be used to specify conditions under which a [flow](/guide/flows) is automatically [run](/guide/flows#runs).

The presence of a trigger step is not required, but without one a flow will only run when it is executed manually.

# Types of triggers<a id="#types" />

1. **Watch** triggers monitor data or events, and activate upon the satisfaction of some user-defined criteria.
1. **Schedule** triggers await a particular user-defined future point in time, upon which they activate themselves.

# Example use cases

## Using watch triggers<a id="#watch" />

1. when a competitor's webpage is updated
1. when a key metric crosses a specific threshold
1. when another flow successfully finishes a run

## Using schedule triggers<a id="#schedule" />

1. **at an absolute point in time:** on 2030-01-01 at 12:00PM PST
