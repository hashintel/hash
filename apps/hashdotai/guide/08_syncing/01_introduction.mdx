# Introduction

HASH is not designed to work in standalone, but to integrate and synchronize different kinds of information from lots of different places.

We believe that you should never have to blindly "switch" from using one app to another. With HASH, you can sync information in and out (two-ways) through a wide variety of [integrations](https://hash.ai/guide/syncing/integrations).

This lets you migrate data over in a safe, secure fashion once you've proven things work as expected -- without any risk of data loss or service interruption. If you're rolling HASH out at an organization, it also means users within your org can gradually switch to HASH over time, moving in cohorts, and/or continuing to use their existing favorite (legacy) tools side-by-side, when preferred.
