# What are plugins?

**Plugins provide access to HASH from inside of other applications.** For example, the HASH [browser extension] allows you to add HASH to your favorite web browser, automatically inferring entities from the web-pages you visit, and allowing you to clip information from around the web as you go (easily adding it to your HASH web).

## HASH Browser extension

Available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari on macOS, Windows and Linux. If you use another browser, [get in touch](/contact).

## Vote for new plugins
