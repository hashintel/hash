# What are plugins?

**Plugins provide access to HASH from inside of other applications.** For example, the HASH [browser extension] will let you add HASH to your favorite web browser, clipping information from around the web and easily adding it to your HASH web (plus a whole lot more).

The forthcoming HASH [Figma plugin] will allow you to browse and insert auto-updating information from HASH into Figma and Figjam files, keeping your designs and files up-to-date with your information stored in HASH.
