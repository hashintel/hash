# What are plugins?

**Plugins provide access to HASH from inside of other applications.** For example, the HASH [browser extension] allows you to add HASH to your favorite web browser, automatically inferring entities from the web-pages you visit, and allowing you to clip information from around the web as you go (easily adding it to your HASH web).

The forthcoming HASH [Figma plugin] will allow you to browse and insert auto-updating information from HASH into Figma and Figjam files, keeping your designs and files up-to-date with your information stored in HASH.
