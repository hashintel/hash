# Overview

Your **inbox** contains actions, notifications and messages that are private to you.

# Actions

[Actions](/guide/inbox/actions) consist of things that are awaiting your attention. AI-suggested improvements, proposed edits and updates from other users, requests from others to review their work, your own unfinished drafts, and pending todos are all things you'll find here.

# Notifications

[Notifications](/guide/inbox/notifications) provide timely informational updates. It's up to you to decide what to do with notifications. You may want to take action in response to some notifications, while others might simply be read, or even ignored.

# Messages

[Messages](/guide/inbox/messages) are private one-on-one or group communications between you and other users of HASH.
