Your **actions** queue contains a range of things:

- **Suggestions** are proposed new entities and types, or updates to existing ones, which you can review from your actions queue. Suggestsions may be generated by HASH's in-built [AI](/guide/ai), produced by [flows](/guide/flows), or submitted by other users (where permissions allow).
- **Drafts** are changes to information in one of your [webs](/guide/webs) which have not yet been persisted. Drafts could relate to entities or types which you previously began creating or editing, but for whatever reason did not finish. Drafts can be viewed and furthed edited or saved/discarded from here.
