# Overview

**Notifications** make individual users of HASH aware of information relevant to them.

# Example Notifications

For example, you might find the following notifications in your inbox:

- a reminder you created has become due;
- another user [shares](/guide/sharing) a page with you, or [@mentions](/guide/webs/users#mention) you in a document
- an urgent (time-sensitive) or critical (important) [action](/guide/inbox/actions) requires your attention

Notifications always originate from one of the following sources:

1. other [users](/guide/webs/users)' actions;
1. [flows](/guide/flows) which contain a notification [action](/guide/flows/actions#notification);
1. HASH itself, such as when an account matter requires your attention.

# Controlling Notifications

You can [control which notifications](/guide/account/notifications) you receive from the "Inbox Settings" page.
