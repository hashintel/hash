You can chat with your workers using natural language. This lets you: 

- **Get answers to questions** extremely quickly, using information in your web, and other public HASH webs
- **Effortlessly grow the information in your web** around any topic of interest, with micro-[research goals](/guide/workers/goals) being created and satisfied by workers at the point of need
- **Capture new information** about entities as linked observations and notes, without having to fill in any forms

# Chat interfaces

## HashGPT<a id="#hashgpt" /><a id="#chatgpt" />

**HashGPT** lets you access information from your [web(s)](/guide/webs) via the official `chat.openai.com` ChatGPT interface.

To get started, you'll need to open [HashGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-i9t0QlD9c-hashgpt) in the GPT Store, and connect your HASH account.

## Chat in HASH

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  The ability to chat with AI workers _inside_ HASH is coming soon. If you'd
  like to help beta test this feature, [create an account](/signup) and we'll
  let you know when it's available to try.
</Callout>

You'll soon be able to **chat** with your AI workers directly in HASH (as well as via ChatGPT), allowing you to do all the things listed above, with the additional benefit of worker's responses being rendered using rich, interactive [blocks](/guide/pages/blocks).
