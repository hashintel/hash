# Chat in HASH

<Callout style="information" type="coming-soon">
  The ability to chat with AI workers _inside_ HASH is coming soon. If you'd
  like to help beta test this feature, [create an account](/signup) and we'll
  let you know when it's available to try.
</Callout>

You'll soon be able to **chat** with your AI workers directly in HASH, allowing you to query your web in natural language, capture new information in entity-form with ease, and set [goals](/guide/workers/goals) to be fulfilled on your behalf. Interactive, rich, detailed responses are rendered using [blocks](/guide/pages/blocks).
