# Overview

You can provide AI [workers](/guide/workers) in HASH with goals, which they'll attempt to satisfy on your behalf.

Workers translate the goals you provide into [goal-directed flows](/guide/flows), which they both plan out, and ultimately execute, checking in on progress as they go, and self-adjusting their steps as necessary.
