# Overview

You can provide AI [workers](/guide/workers) in HASH with goals, which they'll attempt to satisfy on your behalf.

Right now, workers are well-suited to solving **research** and **analysis** goals, including:

- complex, many-step analysis tasks that require the computation of novel metrics;
- targeted deep-dive research according to specific criteria;
- open-ended, general domain mapping, or knowledge graph generation.

In the future, we'll expand the kinds of goals that workers can help support, and the complexity of the tasks they can undertake on your behalf.

You can view workers' activity on goals much like you can the progress of a [flow](/guide/flows). However, unlike a flow, whose steps are _fixed_, while a worker may initially plan out the "steps" it thinks are required to fulfil a goal at the outset, these steps may change over time. In fact, it is quite normal for a work plan produced in service of a goal to be self-adjusted by workers as they progress.

Individual goals may be completed by many workers, speeding up the rate at which they're able to be completed.

# Viewing goals

You can view both active and historical goals by clicking the "Workers" tab in your left-hand sidebar at any time.

Active goals will appear at the top. Historical goals — those marked as either "complete" or "abandoned" — appear in the section beneath.
