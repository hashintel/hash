# Overview

You can provide AI [workers](/guide/workers) in HASH with goals, which they'll attempt to satisfy on your behalf.

Workers translate the goals you provide into [goal-directed flows](/guide/flows), which they both plan out, and ultimately execute, checking in on progress as they go, and self-adjusting their steps as necessary.

# Supported goals

Our current primary focus is on expanding the kind of goals that workers can help support, and the complexity of the tasks they can undertake on your behalf.

Right now, workers are well-suited to solving **research** and **analysis** goals.
