# Introduction

**Workers** are powerful AI agents built into HASH, which answer [questions](/guide/workers/chat), work towards [goals](/guide/workers/goals), and execute [flows](/guide/flows) on your behalf.

To view or manage your workers, click on the "Workers" tab in the left-hand sidebar of the HASH app. From here you'll be able to view their activity, provide them with new goals, or chat with them to get answers directly.

# Answering questions

Workers can also help you understand topics with more expertise and in more detail than ordinary AI chatbots, by combining their own knowledge and access to the World Wide Web, with information from HASH (including data in your own personal [web](/guide/webs)). Answers are supplemented with references to the entity, webpage, or other context used in their production, so you can have more confidence in the underlying reasoning.

# Supporting goals

Workers can help solve goals on your behalf. Currently, workers support research and analysis related tasks — for example, adding new entities to, or enriching existing entities within — your web, by autonomously researching topics and analyzing the collected information.

When conducting research, workers are able to search for and interpret information already in your web, as well as public entities from other [HASH webs](/guide/webs), and the outside World Wide Web. As always, private information within both personal and shared webs is not accessible to anybody else (including other people's workers).

# Managing flows

[Flows](/guide/flows) are pre-defined series of steps that workers can execute. If something goes wrong, depending on how the flow has been set up and defined, the worker executing it has the ability to decide how to do proceed.
