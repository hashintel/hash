# Overview

**Triggers** can be used to specify conditions under which a [flow](/guide/flows) is automatically [run](/guide/flows#runs).

# Types of triggers<a id="#types" />

1. The presence of a **manual** trigger allows a flow to be run on-demand by authorized HASH users.
1. A **responsive** trigger monitors data or events, and starts a flow when some predefined criteria is met.
1. A **schedule** trigger starts a flow at a particular future point in time. This can be either a specific point in time, or a recurring/periodic basis.

# Example use cases

## Using manual triggers<a id="#manual" />

On a one-off, or as-needed basis...

1. Perform chains of related actions with just one-click (allowing multi-step actions to be compressed into reliable, automated flows)
1. Generate reports for stakeholders upon request (servicing requests more quickly and dependably)

## Using responsive triggers<a id="#watch" />

Continuously monitor and respond to...

1. **External events.** e.g. monitor a competitor's blog's RSS feed, and generate a summary for internal consumption when a new post appears, and post to Slack.
1. **External data.** e.g. when some metric in an external application crosses a specific threshold, send an email and SMS alert to the responsible stakeholder.
1. **HASH events.** e.g. when one flow successfully finishes running, start another one in follow-up.
1. **HASH data.** e.g. when an email address appears as an [attribute](/guide/entities/attributes) on an entity in a web, run a reverse-lookup to identify the social media accounts associated with it.

## Using schedule triggers<a id="#schedule" />

1. **Fixed point in time:** e.g. run on 2030-01-01 at 12:00PM PST
1. **Recurring:** e.g. every Friday at 09:00AM EST
