# Overview

**Filters** allow you to use conditional logic in [flows](/guide/flows), enabling branching execution paths and more powerful single runs.

# Example use cases

- **Quality scoring.** In a CRM context, if the value assigned to a particular lead is above a specific quality threshold or score, take a more resource-intensive approach to outreach.
- **Response optimization.** If a subject responds in a particular way to an earlier action, pursue a particualr course of action. Otherwise, pursue another.
- **Robust workflows.** If something fails, try again.
- **Evaluation followups.** Following an evaluation step, depending on the feedback received (whether from an AI agent or a real-life human), respond appropriately.
