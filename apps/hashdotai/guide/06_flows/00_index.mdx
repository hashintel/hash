# Overview

**Flows** are fixed sequences of steps which can be mapped out within HASH, and executed by [workers](/guide/workers) on your behalf.

Flows allow for the reliable, predictable execution of specific actions, in contrast to [goals](/guide/workers/goals), which workers may attempt to satisfy according to their own best judgement.

# Triggers

[Triggers](/guide/flows/triggers) result in the execution of a flow. A single flow may have multiple different possible triggers.

# Steps

Once triggered, flows consist of different kinds of steps, including:

- [Actions](/guide/flows/actions), which do things as part of a flow. These are the most common kind of step.
- [Filters](/guide/flows/filters), which allow for conditional execution of different actions. These allow for branching logic, and the construction of more powerful, responsive flows.
- [Waits](/guide/flows/waits), which allow you to pause flows until a condition is satisfied. Any condition which can trigger a flow can also be used within a wait step.

# Runs

- **One-off:** flows can be run ad-hoc or manually by a user, as required, upon creation or from the [Flows](https://app.hash.ai/flows) page in HASH;
- **Automatic:** flows can also be run without user input, on autopilot, by satisfying a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) present within a flow;
- **Programmatic:** flows can be triggered by external software or function-calling agents using the [HASH API](https://hash.dev/docs/flows/api).

# Permissions

Flows created in your [personal web](/guide/webs#personal-webs) are only ever visible to you. Likewise, flows created in [shared webs](/guide/webs#shared-webs) are only visible to those web's members.

In the future, we'll support make flows public, as well as sharing them with specific users outside of the webs that flows belong to.
