# Overview

**Flows** are sequences of steps which can be mapped out within HASH, and executed by HASH on your behalf.

- **Fixed flows** consist of steps that are defined ahead of time. Every time they these flows are run, the same logic is executed.
- **Goal-directed flows** are actively managed by AI [workers](/guide/workers), in accordance with [user-provided goals](/guide/workers/goals). Each time they are run, your worker determines the best way to achieve your goal. Initially, your worker may "plan" the steps it intends to take, but these are not fixed ahead of runtime, and the worker will continuously evaluate whether steps need to be added, updated, or removed to fulfil the goal.

# Triggers

[Triggers](/guide/flows/triggers) result in the execution of a flow's steps.

# Steps

Once triggered, flows consist of different kinds of steps:

- [Actions](/guide/flows/actions), which do things as part of a flow. These are the most common kind of step.
- [Filters](/guide/flows/filters), which allow for conditional execution of different actions. These allow for branching logic, and the construction of more powerful, responsive flows.
- [Waits](/guide/flows/waits), which allow you to pause flows until a condition is satisfied. Any condition which can trigger a flow can also be used within a wait step.

# Runs

- **One-off:** flows can be run upon creation, and subsequently re-run manually or "ad hoc" by a user, as required, from their [Flows](https://app.hash.ai/flows) page in HASH;
- **Automatic:** flows can also be run without user input, on autopilot, by satisfying a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) present within a flow;
- **Programmatic:** flows can be triggered by external software or function-calling agents using the [HASH API](https://hash.dev/docs/flows/api).

# Permissions

Flows created in your [personal web](/guide/webs#personal-webs) are only ever visible to you. Likewise, flows created in [shared webs](/guide/webs#shared-webs) are only visible to those web's members.

In the future, we'll support make flows public, as well as sharing them with specific users outside of the webs that flows belong to.
