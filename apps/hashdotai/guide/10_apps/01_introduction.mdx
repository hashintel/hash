# Coming Soon

**Apps** are ready-made bundles of blocks, types and pages, which can be added to a web with one click. They work with data that already exists inside your web, without it ever leaving your system, providing you with secure, out-the-box access to workflows, tools and functionality that historically would only have been accessible in standalone applications (e.g. an external CRM, ATS, or ERP system).

Apps are coming soon to HASH. To register for early-access, fill in your email address below.
