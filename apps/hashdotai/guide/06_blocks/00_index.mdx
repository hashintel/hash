# What are blocks?

Blocks are interactive rectangles on a page that can be viewed or edited, used to load data, or provide any other functionality.

# Types of blocks

Blocks can literally contain _anything_ on a page, so there's no real way to categorize them all. Nevertheless, most blocks in HASH can be thought of as **text**, **media**, **data** or **action** blocks.

## Text Blocks

Blocks for capturing and/or displaying text are the most commonly used kinds of blocks in HASH

## Media Blocks

Blocks that are used to display or support interacting with multimedia content such as images, videos, or 3D models.

## Data Blocks

Blocks for visualizing and interacting with entities. e.g. table, kanban, etc.

## Action Blocks

The behavior of some blocks can be "programmed", changing how they work when interacted with by end-users. For example, you can "map" certain kinds of blocks (such as "button" blocks) to actions, enabling them to perform specific functions when clicked. These "[action blocks](/guide/blocks/action)" are a key part of how [apps](/guide/apps) are built in HASH, and we discuss them separately, in the next section of the user guide.

## Other Blocks

There's no limit to what a block can do. For example, there are interactive gaming blocks, such as the Minesweeper block, as well as AI Chat blocks.

If you have your own idea for a block, you can also develop your own [custom block](/guide/blocks/custom) and run it within HASH.
