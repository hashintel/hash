Every entity must have at least one [entity type](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types) associated with it, which in turn specifies the [attributes](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities/attributes) (information) that can be stored about an entity. For example, if you run a business, and you sell a product to a friend, you might represent that person as an entity in your web with multiple types assigned to them, including `Person`, `Customer`, and `Friend`. Likewise, someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger could be represented as a `Person`, `Actor`, `Bodybuilder`, `Politician` _and more_ - and might need to be, in order to ensure that all of the relevant information about him, which you care about, can be stored. Many entities do have multiple types.
