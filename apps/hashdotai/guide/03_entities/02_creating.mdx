# Overview

There are lots of different ways to create new [entities](/guide/entities) in HASH.

# Directly

You can manually create entities directly in HASH using the entity editor. Click the "plus" icon, found on the right-hand side of the top navigation bar in the HASH application, and select "Entity" from the dropdown menu. From the new screen that loads you'll need to pick at least one entity type, in order to enter the [attributes](/guide/entities/attributes) of your new entity. When you're done, simply click the "Create entity" button in the blue banner near the top of the page.

# With integrations

When you set up an [integration](/guide/integrations), HASH automatically creates entites in your web using the information you give it access to. Files, communications, and other data are seamlessly represented in HASH upon integration, and synced with their original source to ensure accuracy.

# With plugins

HASH [plugins](/guide/plugins) can be installed in a growing range of other applications, including [ChatGPT](/guide/plugins#hashgpt) and [your browser](/guide/plugins#browsers). In addition to adding useful capabilties to these applications, HASH plugins can also assist in (or automate) the process of adding new entities to your web. For example, when [passive mode] is enabled in the [HASH browser extension], HASH can automatically extract entities of a specific type you choose from the webpages you visit, as you encounter them, populating your web for you (and eliminating manual data entry work). This can be useful for many types of work such as recruiting or prospecting, as well as with any internet research or comparison task.

# With flows

[Flows](/guide/flows) can be created in HASH to do many things, including adding new entites to your web. This may be the primary aim of a flow (to populate a web with entities, or to keep existing entities up-to-date), or incidentally achieved in fulfilment of a flow's actual goal (e.g. to generate a document on a particular topic). In the case of such "research" tasks, flows may not only culminate in a "deliverable" or "output" like an answer, report, presentation, or spreadsheet table... but also result in the hydration of a web with all of the entities encountered during the course of its run.

You can [create your own flows](/guide/flows/creating) and run them in a [variety of ways](/guide/flows#runs).

Flows can also be conceived and run by AI [workers](/guide/workers), on the basis of [goals](/guide/workers/goals) specified in natural language (e.g. "find me all CTOs of Fortune 500 companies who have been in the role more than 3 years")

All entities added to your web by a flow, or through an AI worker's actions, can be filtered out of a particular view by using the [provenance information](/guide/webs/history) that is stored alongside them.

Entites added to your web by automations can also be held in your [actions](/guide/flows/actions) queue until you're ready to review them, if you prefer, with only select approved entities ultimately added to your web at all.
