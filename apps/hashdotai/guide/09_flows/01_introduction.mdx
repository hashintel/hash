# Coming Soon

**Flows** are actions, or sequences of actions, which can be executed within HASH. These can be triggered **manually** by users (via the HASH user interface), or **programmatically** by machines (via the HASH API, or another HASH Flow).

Flows that are triggered can be set up to run:

1. on a one-time basis;
1. in response to some observation (e.g. when a datapoint crosses a certain threshold); or
1. on a predetermined schedule (e.g. at 12:01AM EST on the 1st of every month).
