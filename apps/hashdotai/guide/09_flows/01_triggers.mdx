# Overview

**Triggers** can be used to specify conditions under which a [flow](/guide/flows) is automatically [run](/guide/flows#runs).

The presence of a trigger step is not required, but without one a flow will only run when it is executed manually.

# Types of Triggers<a id="#types" />

1. **Watchers** monitor data or events, and activate upon the satisfaction of some user-defined criteria. For example:
  1. when a competitor's webpage is updated
  1. when a key metric crosses a specific threshold
1. **Schedulers** await a particular user-defined future point in time, upon which they activate themselves. For example:
  1. _one-time_ at 2030-01-01 at 12:00PM PST
  1. _recurrently_ at 12:01AM EST on the 1st of every month
