# Overview

**Triggers** can be used to specify conditions under which a [flow](/guide/flows) is automatically run. Unlike [action steps](/guide/flows/actions), the presence of a trigger step is not required.

# Types of Triggers

1. in response to some observation (e.g. when a datapoint crosses a certain threshold); or
1. on a predetermined schedule (e.g. at 12:01AM EST on the 1st of every month).
