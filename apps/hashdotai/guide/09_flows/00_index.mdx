# Overview

**Flows** are sequences of steps which can be mapped out within HASH, and executed by HASH on your behalf.

# Steps

Flows consist of different kinds of steps:

- [Triggers](/guide/flows/triggers) which
- [Actions](/guide/flows/actions) which
- [Filters](/guide/flows/filters) which 

# Runs

Flows can be run upon creation, and subsequently re-run **manually** by a user, ad-hoc, from their [Flows](https://app.hash.ai/flows) page in HASH.

Flows can also be triggered **programmatically** in one of two ways:

1. by external software using the [HASH API](https://hash.dev/docs/api);
1. by satisfying a [trigger](/guide/flows/triggers) present within a flow.

# Permissions

You can control the conditions under which flows can be run by using [filters](/guide/flows/filters).
