It's easy to publicly publish or privately share any type or any entity (including pages) in HASH.

This lets you share some things with everybody, while controlling access to others, reading individuals in on certain bits of information, or keeping them entirely private. This flexibility is one of HASH's many unique features.

# Shared webs {#internally}

The easiest way to collaborate with others in HASH is to create an [organization](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/orgs), providing you with a 'shared web' accessible to all of its members.

# Sharing directly with others {#directly}

You can also share individual entities (including pages) and types directly in HASH with other [users](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/users#users), on a one-by-one basis; [orgs](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/orgs#users), providing access to all of their members; and the public (granting unrestricted view permission to anybody who visits the page).
