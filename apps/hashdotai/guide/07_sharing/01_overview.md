It's easy to publicly publish or privately share any type or any entity (including pages) in HASH.

This lets you share some things with everybody, while controlling access to others, reading individuals in on certain bits of information, or keeping them entirely private. This flexibility is one of HASH's many unique features.

# Sharing with others

- [Users](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/users#users) on a one-by-one basis
