# Introduction

By default, the information you create in your personal web is _private_. However, it's easy to publicly publish or selectively share any type or any entity (including pages) in HASH. This allows you to share some things with others, while controlling access to sensitive information.

The easiest way to collaborate with others in HASH is to create an [organization](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/orgs), providing you with a 'shared web' accessible to all of its members.

# Sharing directly with others<a id="#directly" />

You can also share individual entities (including pages) and types directly in HASH with other [users](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/users#users), on a one-by-one basis; [orgs](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/orgs#users), providing access to all of their members; and the public (granting unrestricted view permission to anybody who visits the page).
