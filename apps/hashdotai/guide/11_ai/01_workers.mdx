# Introduction

**AI Workers** help solve _goals_ you provide them with by developing and proposing [flows](/guide/flows) that help you get the job done.

# Supported Goals

Currently, AI Workers support adding new entities to — and enriching existing entities within — your graph, by autonomously researching topics (searching for and parsing information from the World Wide Web, as well as public entities from other [HASH Webs](/guide/webs)).

# Using AI Workers

Click on the "AI" tab in the left-hand sidebar of the HASH app.
