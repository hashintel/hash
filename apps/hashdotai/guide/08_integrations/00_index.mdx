# Introduction

HASH is not designed to work in standalone, but to integrate and supercharge other services, enabling actions within—and synchronizing information between—lots of different places.

HASH integrations don't just let you do things and access information in other applications, but they also **2-way sync** all of your available information, wherever possible. This makes HASH integrations fundamentally different to those you might be used to in other applications, and is a core part of what makes HASH an effective _operating system_.

Data from applications that you integrate with HASH is represented in your web as [entities](/guide/entities), like anything else in HASH. This makes it accessible in [flows](/guide/flows), usable in [apps](/guide/apps), referenceable in [pages](/guide/pages) and loadable in [blocks](/guide/pages/blocks).

**What this means:** we believe that you should never have to blindly "switch" from using one app to another. With HASH, you can sync information in and out (two-ways) through a wide variety of integrations. This lets you migrate data over in a safe, secure fashion once you've proven things work as expected — without any risk of data loss or service interruption. If you're rolling HASH out at an organization, it also means users within your org can gradually switch to HASH over time, moving in cohorts, and/or continuing to use their existing favorite (legacy) tools side-by-side, when preferred.
