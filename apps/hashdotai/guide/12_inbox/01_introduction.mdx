## Introduction

While your [Feed] contains general updates, your **Inbox** contains messages, notifications, and actions specific to you.

## Messages

Messages are private one-on-one or group communications with other users of HASH.

## Notifications

Notifications are purely informational messages which you can either read or ignore. Notifications are triggered when:

- You have been `@mentioned` in a comment, page, or other piece of text.
- A "reminder" becomes due.

## Actions

Actions are [notifications] with one or more expected responses associated with them. Actions may sometimes be time-sensitive. Actions can be triggered by:

- other [users] when they [share] or [mention] you
- third-party service [integrations]
- [flows], which may have a "human in the loop" step, or otherwise require some action if they become stuck
- [apps] you create or install
