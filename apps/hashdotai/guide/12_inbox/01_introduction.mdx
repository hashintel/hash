## Introduction

While your [Feed](https://hash.ai/guide/feed) contains general updates, your **Inbox** contains messages and notifications specific to you.

## Messages

Messages are private one-on-one or group communications with other users of HASH.

## Notifications

Notifications make you aware of other key information. Some notifications require action, while others may be purely informational messages which you can either read or ignore.

You can [control which notifications](https://hash.ai/guide/account/notifications) you receive from the "Inbox Settings" page.

### Example notifications

Notifications cover lots of different kinds of events. For example, they may be triggered when:
- another user shares a page with you, or `@mentions` you in some text - _no action required_
- one of your connections has a birthday, or other significant event (e.g. anniversary) - _no action required_
- system messages sent to the primary email address associated with your account can no longer be delivered - _action required: update your email address_
- the payment method associated with your account has expired - _action required: [update payment method](https://hash.ai/guide/account/billing)_

### Notification origins

Notifications always originate from one of the following sources:
1. other [users](https://hash.ai/guide/webs/users)' actions
1. third-party service [integrations](https://hash.ai/guide/syncing/integrations)
1. [flows](https://hash.ai/guide/flows), which may have a "human in the loop" step, or otherwise require some action if they become stuck
1. [apps](https://hash.ai/guide/apps) you create or install
1. HASH itself, such as when a legal, billing or security matter requires attention
