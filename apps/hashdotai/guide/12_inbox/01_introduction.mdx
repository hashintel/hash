## Introduction

While your [Feed] contains general updates, your **Inbox** contains messages, notifications, and actions specific to you.

## Messages

Messages are private one-on-one or group communications with other users of HASH.

## Notifications

Notifications are purely informational messages which you can either read or ignore.

For example, a notification may be triggered when:
- you are `@mentioned` in a comment, page, or other piece of text
- another user shares a page or entity with you
- one of your connections has a birthday, or other significant event (e.g. anniversary).

You can control which notifications you receive from the [Inbox Settings] page.

## Actions

Actions are [notifications] with one or more expected responses associated with them. Actions may sometimes be time-sensitive. Actions can be triggered by:

- third-party service [integrations]
- [flows], which may have a "human in the loop" step, or otherwise require some action if they become stuck
- [apps] you create or install
- HASH itself, such as when a legal, billing or security matter requires attention

You can control the kind of actions you're alerted to from the [Inbox Settings] page. Not all kinds of actions can be disabled.
