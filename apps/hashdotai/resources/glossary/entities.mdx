## What are entities?

Entities are individual “things” with a distinct, independent existence.

Every entity in HASH has:

- a HASH ID, which makes it uniquely identifiable and content-addressable;
- one or more [entity types](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-type) which describe the entity’s expected properties;
- [properties](https://hash.ai/glossary/properties), infered from its entity type(s), which may in turn contain [values](https://hash.ai/glossary/values).

The _entity type_ tells you what kind of thing an entity is expected to be (e.g. a `Book`, which is expected to have properties such as `author`, `title` and `publisher`).

The values of an entity’s properties tell you about that instance of the entity itself, for example what its `title` actually is (e.g. “Brave New World”).

Sometimes the values of a property may contain [links](https://hash.ai/glossary/links). In such cases, we would describe an entity as a _linked entity_.

## What are linked entities?

In the real world, entities are often connected to other entities, and these connections are described as _relationships_.

Sometimes these connections take the form of social relationships (e.g. “Mother", "Child”, or “Friend") occurring between entities of the same [entity type] (in this example `Person`).

However, entities of completely different entity types can also be linked. For example, connections between entities may sometimes be legal or procedural, such as “Employee \<\> Employer” or “Politician \<\> Political Party”, which may both link a `Person` with an `Organization`.

A network of entities which are connected to other entities is sometimes called a [graph](https://hash.ai/glossary/graphs). We call these entities with links ‘linked entities’.

## Are entities the same thing as 'agents'?

If you’re using our advanced [HASH for simulation](https://hash.ai/index) platform, you might be wondering about the relationship between entities and [agents](https://hash.ai/glossary/agent-based-modeling). For all practical purposes, you can think of both as the same thing. In future releases of [HASH Core](https://hash.ai/platform/core) and [HASH Engine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine) we’ll support instantiating entities from a HASH workspace directly within simulations (as agents), as well as assigning expected [behaviors](https://hash.ai/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/behaviors) to entity types in [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash).
