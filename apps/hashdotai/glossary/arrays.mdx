In programming, **arrays** are collections of [variables](/glossary/variables) or [values](/glossary/values), each of which can be identified within the array by at least one "key" (typically its position in the array). Arrays themselves can in turn also be variables or values.

Some data types are arrays. For example, `Color` when expressed as an `RGB` value, contains three numbers which refer to the relative amount of red, green, and blue light that make up a color (each on a scale of 0 to 255). For example, `0,0,0` is white, `255,0,0` is red, `0,0,255` is blue, and `255,255,255` is black.

In HASH, arrays are found in the context of [property types](/guide/types/property-types). Property types describe the acceptable value(s) that a property can have. They are either expressed as [data types](/guide/types/data-types), property objects (other property types, nested within the parent), or arrays (which can contain data-typed values, property objects, or further nested arrays).
