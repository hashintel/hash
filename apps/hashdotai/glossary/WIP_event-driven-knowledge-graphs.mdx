**Event-driven knowledge graphs** sit at the intersection of [discrete event models](/glossary/discrete-event-modeling) which help simulate processes and the state of real-world systems, and [knowledge graphs](/glossary/knowledge-graphs) which help represent objects, events, situations, or concepts (often using [graph databases](/glossary/graph-databases)).

By introducing an event-driven approach (aka. “event sourcing via streaming platforms”), platforms like HASH can extract and link data from multiple data silos in near real time. In practice, an event-sourcing pipeline streams key data changes (events) from disparate systems, deduplicates and unifies them, and updates a knowledge graph accordingly – resulting in an up-to-date, event-driven knowledge graph. This differs from traditional knowledge graphs that are typically entity-centric and updated in batches or via periodic processes. Traditional KGs capture mostly static facts and relationships, whereas an event-driven KG continually incorporates dynamic, temporal information (events) as first-class data. As such, event-driven graphs are always evolving to reflect the latest state of the business.
