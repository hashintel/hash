**Vectors** are values which cannot be expressed as a single number (a [scalar](/glossary/scalars)).

For example, _velocity_ is a vector which measures both the magnitude (speed) an object is moving at, as well as its direction, and is written in a form similar to `5 meters per second northeast`. _Displacement_ and _force_ are other common vectors in physics which have both magnitudes and directions.

These stand in contrast to measures such as _speed_ by itself, a scalar, which can simply be written as `5 meters per second` (as it contains only the magnitude of a thing, and no directional information).

However, vectors don't have to contain magnitude and direction, but rather any two or more kinds of information, combined. Common sorts of vectors include tuples (such as a color expressed as an RGB value) and arrays.

_Ordinary users of HASH don't need to know what vectors are, and this information is provided as a reference for advanced [type modelers](/guide/types) only._
