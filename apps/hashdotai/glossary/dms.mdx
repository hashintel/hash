## What is a DMS?

A Document Management System (**DMS**) helps with the storage and management of large numbers of documents, including documents for which many different versions od drafts may exist. They help keep track of the information contained within documents, storing information as metadata associated with each document.

Records in a document management system may correspond to editable digital originals of files (e.g. `DOCX` files), electronic representations of physical paper documents (e.g. a `PDF` scan of a letter received), or finalized signed documents (e.g. an e-signed file, or scan of a physically signed documented).

## Common DMS features

- **Check-in/check-out:** when a user checks out a document, it is marked as being edited by that user. This prevents other users from making changes to the document until it is checked back in. This ensures that one person’s edits do not overwrite another’s. Once the user has finished editing the document, they check it back in, making the new version available for others to edit. This process ensures that changes are systematically updated and tracked.
- **Version control:** the check-in/check-out system often integrates with version control, where each checked-in document is saved as a new version. This allows tracking of changes over time, making it possible to revert to previous versions if necessary and providing a history of modifications.
- **History, provenance and lineage:** by tracking who checks out and checks in documents, the system maintains an audit trail of who made specific changes and when. This accountability is critical for compliance and for understanding the evolution of a document.
- **Recovery capabilities:** when things go wrong, DMSs can allow older versions of documents to be recovered.
- **Supporting collaboration:** many DMSs contain "multiplayer" functionality allowing other authorized users to see the current status of a document (checked out or available) and plan their work accordingly. This structured approach facilitates efficient teamwork.
- **Annotation:** most DMSs allow multiple users to add comments, notes, and suggestions directly on the document, enabling team members to provide feedback without altering the original content of the document. Inline annotations can be attached to specific parts of a document, making it clear why certain changes were made or what further actions are required. By allowing comments and feedback to left inline, the need for back-and-forth communication can help streamline the editing and review process.
- **Stamping:** stamps can be used to quickly apply standardized marks such as “Approved,” “Rejected,” “Confidential,” or “Draft” on documents. This helps in quickly conveying the status or classification of a document without needing to read through it, and so that the information is clearly labeled when printed, or otherwise redistributed.
- **Labeling:** like stamps, labels can often be attached to documents. In contrast to stamps, which are visible on documents, labels are generally stored as metadata, and are used to classify or categorize documents (both for organizational, and legal/compliance purposes). They also help improve the discoverability of documents in a DMS, allowing for filtering and searching by label.

## Who uses DMSs?

- **Law firms:** managing case files, contracts, legal documents, and client correspondence. This helps track cases, and flows of information end-to-end, reducing human-error, helping track subtle changes within large amounts of text, and providing secure access to sensitive information.
- **Healthcare organizations:** managing patient records, medical histories, treatment plans, and insurance documentation; improving patient care by providing quick access to patient information, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA (in the US), and securing sensitive patient data.
- **Financial services:** handling financial reports, client information, transaction records, and compliance documents. In this case, a DMS can enhance data security, and be used to ensure (and evidence) regulatory compliance, while improving the efficiency of teams dealing with large amounts of documents.
- **Consultancies:** many firms have large internal knowledgebases containing past engagement deliverables (often in both "sensitive" and "sanitized" form), and vast amounts of original research categorized and stored within DMSs. Access to these helps improve internal expertise, providing easy-access to relevant past insights and case context, while enhancing project management efficiency.

## Using DMS information with AI

Connecting your DMS to HASH enables it to be used by [AI workers](/guide/workers) acting on your behalf - for example, you can connect to an existing DMS like DocuWare, PandaDoc, LogicalDoc, FileHold, Alfresco, Laserfiche, or eFileCabinet; an internal intranet based on Microsoft Sharepoint, Confluence, or Google Workspace; or a file-sharing solution like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive.

Once your document management system is connected to HASH, the information within it will be indexed in an optimized fashion, available for use in [research jobs](/guide/workers/goals) and when [chatting](/guide/workers/chat) with your workers.
