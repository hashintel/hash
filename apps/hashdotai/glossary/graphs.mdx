## What are graphs?

### In HASH

In the context of HASH, a graph is a collection of [entities](/glossary/entities) which may be connected to other entities by [links](/glossary/links).

The data and [types](/glossary/types) in a single HASH workspace are known as a [web](/guide/webs), and these can be thought of as a graph in which some information might be kept private, while other parts may be shared publicly.

The totality of all public data in HASH, sometimes called the "[HASH public web](https://hash.ai/guide/webs#hash-public-web)", may also be thought of as a graph, as many individual workspaces are connected to each other through [linked entities](/glossary/entities#Linked-entities) and shared types.

### In the Block Protocol

The [Block Protocol](/glossary/block-protocol) module which deals with entities and the links between them is known as the _Graph_ module.

### In mathematics and computer science

A graph is a data structure with **nodes** and **edges**. Nodes are sometimes also called ‘vertices’ or ‘points’, and edges are sometimes also referred to as ‘lines’ or ‘links’ (the term we use in HASH).

The edges of graphs can be **directed** or **undirected**, reflecting the nature of a connection between two nodes. For example, an edge reflecting a ‘sibling’ relationship between two sisters would be undirected, but an edge representing a debt owed by one to the other would be directed.
