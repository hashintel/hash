## What are graphs?

### In HASH

In the context of HASH, a graph is a collection of entities which may be connected to other entities by [links](https://hash.ai/glossary/links).

The data in a single HASH workspace can be thought of as a graph, some of which may be kept private, and parts of which may be public.

The totality of all public data in HASH may also be thought of as a graph, as many individual workspaces are connected through [linked entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities#Linked-entities) and shared [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/types).

### In the Block Protocol

The [Block Protocol](https://hash.ai/glossary/block-protocol) module which deals with entities and the links between them is known as the _Graph Module_.

### In mathematics and computer science

A graph is a data structure with **nodes** and **edges**. Nodes are sometimes also called ‘vertices’ or ‘points’, and edges are sometimes also referred to as ‘lines’ or ‘links’ (the term we use in HASH).

The edges of graphs can be **directed** or **undirected**, reflecting the nature of a connection between two nodes. For example, an edge reflecting a ‘sibling’ relationship between two sisters would be undirected, but an edge representing a debt owed by one to the other would be directed.
