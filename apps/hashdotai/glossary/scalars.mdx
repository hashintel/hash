**Scalars** are [variables](/glossary/variables) which hold individual [values](/glossary/values).

**Numerical scalar values** are numerical values which indicate the magnitude of something -- for example, the mass of an object (e.g. `6 kilograms`), or the distance between two points (`5 miles`). Numbers which are scalars are usually integers, fixed points, or floats.

Scalars stand in contrast to [vectors](/glossary/vectors), which are things such as velocity (the _speed_ of something AND the direction it is headed in - e.g. `5 meters per second northeast`), which combine multiple values in an [array](/glossary/arrays).

_Ordinary users of HASH don't need to know what scalars are, and this information is provided as a reference for advanced [type modelers](/guide/types) only._
