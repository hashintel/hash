## What are data types?

**Data types** describe a space of possible valid [values](https://hash.ai/glossary/values). For instance, the _string_ value `foo` might be an instance of a `Text` data type, or a _float_ value of `0.6` might be an instance of a `Number` data type.

Data types describe their possible values by specifying _constraints_. For an instance of a value to be _valid_, it must satisfy the constraints expressed on the associated data type.

Data types consist of the following:

- a **required** `url`, which is a globally unique identifier, where the data type’s definition can be accessed (in most cases this will be a URL)
- a **required** `name`, which should generally be a non-pluralized short description of the data type (for example: “Number” not “Numbers”)
- **optionally** a `description` to further explain the semantic meaning of the data type
- a **required** definition of its possible value

### Top-level data types in HASH

The [Block Protocol](https://hash.ai/glossary/block-protocol) specifies a set of primitive top-level data types, which we use in [HASH](https://hash.ai/).

These can be considered the least restrictive value spaces:

- `Text`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Null`
- `Object`
