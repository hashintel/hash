## What is a dataset?

A collection of numbers or words, generally centered around a single particular topic or subject.

Datasets are most commonly compiled and stored in a tabular format (for example, as a CSV file).

Typically, each row corresponds to one [entity](/glossary/entities), and each column to a [property](/glossary/properties). The intersection of each column and row contains the relevant propertyâ€™s [value](/glossary/values).

## Where do datasets come from?

Datasets are typically compiled from observations and measurements made by people, recorded through sensors, or otherwise tracked by software systems.

## Synthetic Data

Datasets can also be _[generated](/glossary/synthetic-data-generation)_ for the purpose of training a [machine learning](/glossary/machine-learning) model, or providing a dataset that approximates a real-world one, without exposing potentially sensitive real underlying data.
