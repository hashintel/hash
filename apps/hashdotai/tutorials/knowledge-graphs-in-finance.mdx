The finance industry was one of the early adopters of graph techniques for tasks like fraud detection and risk management. Financial data naturally forms networks: think of banks with customers, accounts, transactions, devices, merchants, etc., all interlinked. Fraudulent activities often hide in those connections (for example, a ring of bank accounts funneling money between them, or a set of credit card transactions linked by common device or location that indicates identity theft). Knowledge graphs offer a way to model and analyze these complex relationships, going beyond what traditional transaction monitoring systems can do.

# Applications

## Fraud detection and compliance

Banks and financial institutions use knowledge graphs to monitor the flow of money across their customer base and to detect anomalies that might indicate fraud or money laundering. By linking entities like individuals, companies, accounts, transfers, and external data (e.g. watchlists of bad actors), a graph can reveal suspicious patterns – such as a set of accounts connected by shared phone numbers or addresses forming an unexpected cluster, or circular money movements that resemble laundering schemes. A relational database might flag individual suspicious transactions, but a knowledge graph can reveal the **network pattern** of transactions. This has made KGs a valuable tool in **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** and **KYC (Know Your Customer)** initiatives. For example, a bank could use a KG to ensure it has a full picture of a customer’s relationships: if several customers share a business entity or if funds are moving between them in complex ways, the graph brings that to light, helping compliance officers investigate potential shell companies or fraud rings.

One notable advantage is speed and efficiency in identifying complex fraud patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. Graph analysis techniques like link analysis and community detection can uncover structures (like rings, chains, hubs) in the transaction network that signal fraud. As *Communications of the ACM* [reports](https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/leveraging-graph-databases-for-fraud-detection-in-financial-systems/#:~:text=Graph%20databases%20reveal%20patterns%20and,fraud%20faster%20and%20more%20efficiently), graph databases “reveal patterns and relationships that would otherwise be hidden, allowing financial institutions to detect fraud faster and more efficiently”. In one scenario, an insurance company might use a knowledge graph to detect fraudulent claims by linking claimants, accidents, vehicles, repair shops, and adjusters – exposing if the same phone number or address is being used across many claims, or if a ring of people are coordinating fake accidents. Traditional fraud rules might not catch that if each claim alone looks ordinary, but the knowledge graph can connect the dots.

## Risk analysis and knowledge management

Beyond fraud, financial firms use knowledge graphs for broader knowledge management and decision support. An **enterprise knowledge graph** at a bank might connect internal data (like org structure, projects, documents, client data) to support an internal search or expertise location system. In investment banking or asset management, a KG can integrate market data, company profiles, news sentiment, and relationships (e.g., company A is a supplier for company B, or executive X sits on the board of Y and Z) – which can be invaluable for risk assessment or identifying indirect exposures. For example, if a geopolitical event happens, a knowledge graph might quickly show a bank which of its portfolio companies are related to that region or to affected commodities through a chain of relationships, thus informing strategy.

## Customer service and personalization

Banks also have started to use knowledge graphs to get a 360-view of customers (similar to customer 360 in other industries). By linking accounts, transaction history, customer interactions, and possibly social media or demographic data, banks can personalize services or detect if a customer might need a certain product. While this is akin to a recommendation use case, it’s worth noting that the graph can help maintain consistency in how a customer is treated across departments by having all their data linked.

# Benefits

For finance, the business case for KGs often comes down to **risk reduction and increased compliance efficiency** (catching bad actors sooner, avoiding regulatory fines) and **improved customer insights** (leading to better service or cross-sell opportunities).

* **Fraud and AML** investigators can work more effectively using graph visualizations of suspicious networks, rather than poring over tables of transactions. J.P. Morgan, HSBC, and other major banks have publicly discussed their use of knowledge graphs/graph databases for these purposes, noting significant improvements in detecting complex fraud patterns.  
* Another benefit is in **regulatory reporting** – banks need to aggregate data for regulations like Basel III or GDPR, and a knowledge graph can help trace the lineage of data and how different entities are related when assembling reports (e.g., finding all data related to a particular customer across systems can be done via the graph).

The challenges here include the **scale** of the data (millions of nodes/edges representing accounts and transactions require robust graph processing capabilities) and data privacy (financial data is sensitive, so the KG must have proper access controls). Also, integrating a graph solution into legacy bank IT systems can be non-trivial. Nonetheless, the ability of KGs to **fuse structured and unstructured data** (like combining transaction logs with text reports or alerts) and to provide an explainable link analysis makes them increasingly indispensable in financial cybersecurity and intelligence operations.
