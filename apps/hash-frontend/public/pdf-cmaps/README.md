`.bcmap` files are "binary character maps" — text files used in PostScript and other Adobe products to map character codes to character glyphs in CID fonts. (See: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40634723))

[This spec document](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5014.CIDFont_Spec.pdf) by Adobe outlines what CID fonts are good for (primarily useful when dealing with East Asian writing systems; a legacy support technology).

These files are used when displaying PDFs containing CID fonts and therefore need to be publicly accessible.
