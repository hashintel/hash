COMMENT
  ON TABLE "closed_entity_types_to_constituent_types" IS $pga$ 
    This table represents a transitive closure of an inheritance chain for a given entity type. 
    This is also able to represent "anonymous" entity types which are combinations of (compatible) 
    entity types.

COMMENT
  ON TABLE "entity_types_to_closed_entity_types" IS $pga$ 
    This table represents the mapping from entity types to their closure. 
    This allows for an entity type to find its ancestor entity types.
