# HASH Development Guide

## Repository Structure and Navigation

The HASH repository is organized into several key directories:

- `/apps` - Core applications powering HASH
  - `/hash-api` - Backend API service
  - `/hash-frontend` - Web frontend application
  - `/hash-graph` - Graph database service
  - `/hash-external-services` - External service integrations
  - `/hash-ai-worker-ts` - AI worker services
  - `/hash-integration-worker` - Integration worker services

- `/blocks` - Block Protocol components (each subfolder contains a self-contained block)

- `/libs` - Shared libraries and packages
  - `/@blockprotocol` - Block Protocol related libraries
  - `/@hashintel` - HASH-specific libraries
  - `/@local` - Internal libraries for the monorepo
  - Other core libraries (e.g., `error-stack`)

- `/infra` - Deployment and infrastructure code
  - `/docker` - Docker configurations
  - `/terraform` - Terraform infrastructure as code

- `/tests` - Test suites spanning multiple components

**Navigation Tips:**

- When exploring a new feature, first identify which app or lib it belongs to
- Related code is typically co-located within the same directory
- Check existing implementations before creating new ones
- For understanding cross-component interactions, look for integration tests in `/tests`

## Coding Standards Reference

**IMPORTANT: I must ALWAYS read the full coding standards at the beginning of EACH session using this command:**

```bash
cat .cursor/rules/*
```

The rules in `.cursor/rules/*` contain detailed guidelines for:

- Git commit conventions
- Rust coding style (type system, async patterns, function arguments, etc.)
- Documentation practices (structure, links, error documentation, etc.)
- Error handling with error-stack
- Testing strategy and assertions
- Tracing and instrumentation

These full guidelines contain critical nuances and details that cannot be summarized. Reading the complete rules is essential for ensuring code quality and consistency.

## Documentation Best Practices

When documenting Rust code, follow these guidelines:

1. **Function Documentation Structure**:
   - Begin with a clear, single-line summary of what the function does
   - Include a detailed description of the function's behavior
   - For simple functions (0-2 parameters), describe parameters inline in the main description
   - For complex functions (3+ parameters), use an explicit "# Arguments" section with bullet points
   - Always describe return values in the main description text, not in a separate section
   - Document error conditions with an explicit "# Errors" section

2. **Type Documentation**:
   - Begin with a clear, single-line summary of what the type represents
   - Explain the type's purpose, invariants, and usage patterns
   - Document struct fields with field-level doc comments
   - Document enum variants clearly

3. **Examples**:
   - Include practical examples for public APIs
   - Ensure examples compile and demonstrate typical usage patterns
   - For complex types/functions, show multiple usage scenarios

This balanced approach maintains readability while providing necessary structure for complex APIs.

## Tracing and Instrumentation

### Function-level Instrumentation (Preferred)

For most cases, use `#[tracing::instrument]` directly on functions:

```rust
// ✅ Best - automatic span creation with function name and arguments
#[tracing::instrument(level = "info", skip(self))]
async fn compile_query(&self, params: &QueryParams) -> Result<Query, Error> {
    // Function body automatically wrapped in span
}

// ✅ Good - customize span name and fields
#[tracing::instrument(level = "info", name = "db_query", skip(self), fields(table = %table_name))]
async fn execute_query(&self, table_name: &str) -> Result<Rows, Error> {
    // Function body
}
```

### Manual Instrumentation for Async Calls

When adding tracing spans to async code, use `.instrument()` before `.await`:

```rust
// ✅ Good - clean and readable
let result = some_async_function()
    .instrument(tracing::info_span!("operation_name"))
    .await?;

// ❌ Avoid - unnecessarily verbose
let result = async {
    some_async_function().await
}
.instrument(tracing::info_span!("operation_name"))
.await?;
```

### Span Context Inheritance

Use `.in_current_span()` when span context would otherwise be lost:

```rust
// ✅ Required for spawned tasks
tokio::spawn(async {
    background_work().await
}.in_current_span());

// ❌ Bad - loses tracing context
tokio::spawn(async {
    background_work().await
});

// ✅ Required for non-async functions returning Future with combinators
#[tracing::instrument]
fn some_function() -> impl Future<Output = Result<T, E>> {
    async_operation()
        .and_then(|x| other_operation(x))
        .in_current_span()  // Required because no .await possible here
}

// ✅ Not needed - async functions inherit span context automatically
#[tracing::instrument]
async fn some_function() -> Result<T, E> {
    let result = async_operation().await?;  // Span context preserved automatically
    other_operation(result).await
}
```

**Simple Rule: Use `.in_current_span()` when you CANNOT use `.await`**

### Synchronous Span Execution

For synchronous operations within a specific span context:

```rust
// ✅ Execute synchronous work within a span
let span = tracing::info_span!("sync_operation", field = %value);
let result = span.in_scope(|| {
    expensive_computation()
});
```

**Prefer `.in_scope()` over `.enter()` when possible:**

- **Cannot use `.await`**: `.in_scope()` requires a synchronous closure - cannot accidentally mix async code
- **Clear boundaries**: Explicit scope for when the span is active

### Span API Reference

**Creating and Entering Spans:**

- `tracing::info_span!("name")` - Create a span
- `span.in_scope(|| { ... })` - Execute closure within span context
- `span.enter()` - Enter span context (less preferred than `.in_scope()`, in particular in async code as it's not compatible with `.await`)
- `#[tracing::instrument]` - Automatic function-level instrumentation

**Async Span Integration:**

- `.instrument(span)` - Wrap Future with span
- `.in_current_span()` - Inherit current span context for Future
- `#[tracing::instrument]` - Automatic function-level instrumentation

### When to Use Each Approach

- **Function-level (`#[instrument]`)**: Use for entire functions, especially when you want to trace function entry/exit and arguments
- **Manual (`.instrument()`)**: Use for specific async operations within a function or when you need fine-grained control over span creation
- **Context inheritance (`.in_current_span()`)**: Use when span context would otherwise be lost (spawned tasks, combinator chains without `.await`)

## Creating code context in Rust

To get an idea about an API in rust, the easiest way is to generate it's documentation:

```bash
# Generate documentation without opening it
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features --package <package-name>

# Generate documentation for the entire workspace
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features --workspace
```

These commands will generate HTML documentation from the code and docstrings, providing a comprehensive view of the crate's structure, public API, and usage examples. This approach is particularly effective for:

1. Understanding a crate's organization and component relationships
2. Exploring available functions, types, and traits
3. Finding usage examples in doctest code blocks
4. Understanding error conditions and handling
5. Generating test data based on documented structures

## Branch Naming Convention

**IMPORTANT: Branch names should always include the Linear ticket number.**

When creating branches for Linear issues, use the format:

- `<shortname>/h-XXXX-description`

Examples:

- `t/h-4892-support-baseurl-and-version-filter`
- `alice/h-1234-add-user-authentication`
- `bob/h-5678-resolve-database-connection-issue`

This ensures traceability between code changes and Linear issues, making it easier to:

- Track progress on specific tickets
- Link PRs to their corresponding issues
- Maintain a clear development history

## Pull Request Template

**IMPORTANT: PR titles should start with the Linear issue number in format `H-XXXX: Description`**

When creating PRs, use the template located at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. This template ensures consistency and includes all necessary sections:

- Purpose and high-level explanation
- Related links (Linear issues, discussions, etc.)
- Detailed changes and implementation notes
- Pre-merge checklist for publishable libraries
- Documentation and Turbo Graph impact assessment
- Testing coverage and manual testing steps

Examples of proper PR titles:

- `H-4922: Add branch naming and PR template instructions to CLAUDE.md`
- `H-1234: Implement user authentication system`
- `H-5678: Fix database connection timeout issue`

The template helps reviewers understand the context and ensures all important aspects are covered before merging.

# PR Review Guide

When reviewing a Pull Request, follow these steps to provide comprehensive feedback:

## 1. Initial Information Gathering

Always collect the following information first:

- PR content (description, title, etc.)
- Diff changes (show ALL the changes – don't pipe them into head. Don't use --name-only)
- Existing comments and conversation

Use the following commands:

**1a. View PR metadata, description, general comments and changed files**

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>
```

**1b. View comments on the diff**

```bash
gh api \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/comments
```

## 2. Check Referenced Linear Issues

- Look for Linear issue references in the PR title or description (format: H-XXXX)
- Fetch each referenced Linear issue to understand the original requirements
- Use these requirements as the baseline for your review

```bash
# Example of fetching a Linear issue
mcp__linear__get_issue --issueId "H-XXXX"
```

## 3. Provide Code Quality Feedback

- Be precise about the location and nature of issues
- Include suggestions for improvement when possible
- Reference relevant code standards from the repository
