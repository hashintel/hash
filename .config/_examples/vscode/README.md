# Using these files

To use the files in this directory:

- Create a new `.vscode` directory in the root of the repository.
- Copy the relevant files into your newly created `.vscode` directory.
- If using one of the `extensions-*.json` files, remove the `-*` portion of the file name, so it just reads `extensions.json`.
