# Overview

Organizations (or "orgs") are essentially 'groups' created by users in HASH, with their own dedicated web. These shared webs make it easy to collaborate with other users, manage work around a particular project or area, and separate out work from home.

Orgs can contain one or more members, with no upper limit, provided at least one member holds the organization **role** of `Owner`, responsible for managing it in HASH.

Like [users](/guide/webs/users), orgs also have their own public [profile](/guide/account/profile).

## Creating an org<a id="#create" />

You can create an org by clicking the "Create organization" button on your [Settings > Organizations](https://app.hash.ai/settings/organizations) dashboard, in HASH. You will need to enter a display name (e.g. `Acme Corp`), and an account name (e.g. `@acmecorp`) for the organization, after which you will be able to invite other members.

## Shared webs<a id="#web" />

When you create an organization, you'll note that it has its own web. This **shared web** is a separated space for information, distinct from your [personal web](/guide/webs/users#web), with a different set of default [permissions](/guide/sharing).

Whereas in your personal web, by default, new information is visible only to you, in a shared web it may be accessible to all other members of the org.

Visibility and access permissions can be controlled on a per-entity and per-type basis to override these defaults.

## Inviting others<a id="#invite" />

Depending on an org's settings, its members may invite others to join it at any time. On _Team_ and _Ultra_ [plans](/pricing), the ability for members to invite others can be disabled.

To do so, visit the [Organizations](https://app.hash.ai/settings/organizations) page in HASH, and click on the organization you wish to invite another user to join. Next, click on the "Members" tab, followed by the "Invite new members" button once the page has loaded.

## Roles

**Roles** allow different members of an org to hold different permissions in relation to its management and maintenance.

- **Owners** of an org may add or remove any member of an org, including other owners, and have full access to all org settings. This includes the ability to change the role of any member.
- **Administrators** of an org have the same set of permissions as _owners_, except that they cannot add or remove the _owner_ role from a member, nor can they remove users with the _owner_ role from the organization.
- **Members** have access to a web, but cannot change their own or any other user's role.

## Profiles<a id="#profile" />

Similar to [users](/guide/webs/users), orgs have their own profiles.
