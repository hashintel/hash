# Overview

You don't need to understand all of the concepts outlined on this page in order to [Get Started](/guide/introduction/get-started) with HASH, but being familiar with them will help you learn HASH faster.

We recommend having a quick scan of this page as you start out, and returning to it later when you need more information about a particular thing. In addition to defining key terms you'll find throughout the docs, these concepts provide a broad sense as to the types of features and capabilities that are present within HASH.

# Where information lives

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={
    <div style={{ display: "flex", columnGap: "8px", alignItems: "center" }}>
        <UserIcon />
        <span style={{
            color: "#758AA1",
            textAlign: "center",
            fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif",
            fontSize: "32px",
            fontStyle: "normal",
            fontWeight: 400,
            lineHeight: 1.5,
            letterSpacing: "-0.64px",
            width: "24px",
         }}>+</span>
         <UsersIcon />
    </div>
}>

## Accounts

We use the term 'account' to refer to both users and organizations (aka. "orgs") in HASH.

All users and orgs have an account name, such as **@example**. This can be used to access an account's public profile, such as at [hash.ai/@example](https://app.hash.ai/@example).

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<CircleNodesIcon />}>

## Webs

Every user and every org has their own [web](/guide/webs), containing **entities** (data) and **types** (descriptions of data).

User webs are known as [personal webs](/guide/webs/users#web), and org webs as [shared webs](/guide/webs/orgs#web).

You can access any number of shared webs, in addition to your own personal web.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

# How information is stored

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<AtomSimpleIcon />}>

## Entities

Data in a web exists in the form of [entities](/guide/entities). Entities have:

- An [entity type](#entity-types) which describes “what they are” and what kinds of attributes may be associated with them
- Any number of [attribute values](#attributes) which contain an entity’s properties and links (structured data)
- Any number of claims (observations about an entity that don’t fit into its existing/available attributes)
- Any number of notes, which allow completely unstructured information to be associated with an entity

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<AsteriskIcon />}>

## Entity Types

An individual entity may have one or more [entity types](/guide/types/entity-types), which describe what sort of thing(s) an entity is, and the kinds of structured information (known as [attributes](/guide/entities/attributes)) that can be associated with it.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<DatabaseIcon />}>

## Attributes

[Attributes](/guide/entities/attributes) are structured information stored on an entity’s record. Their values are either **properties** (which contain data) or **links** (which point to other entities).

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<LinkIcon />}>

## Link Types

Every **link** attribute has a [link type](/guide/types/link-types) which describes what its value refers to and provides it with a label.

Constraints on the specific entities, or type(s) of entities that a link may point to, are also defined by the link’s type.

**Example link type:** <code>Employed By</code> (may point to `Company`)

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<TagIcon />}>

## Property Types

Every **property** attribute has a [property type](/guide/types/property-types) which describes what its value refers to, and outlines the format(s) of data (i.e. the [data types](#data-types)) that it accepts.

**Example property type:** <code>Average Temperature</code>

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<BarcodeIcon />}>

## Data Types

While property types provide semantic meaning to property values, [data types](/guide/types/data-types) define the range of accepted values, and specify the labels that should be shown in conjunction with them.

**Example data types:** <code>Celcius</code> and <code>Farenheit</code>

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<ClockRotateLeftIcon />}>

## History

[History](/guide/webs/history) in HASH refers to three things:

1. **change tracking:** a complete record of all the changes to an entity or type over time
2. **versioning:** the ability to inspect, access and even use older versions of an entity or type
3. **provenance:** the ability to see where information and changes originated, as well as what caused them

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

# Using HASH

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<ZapThinIcon />}>

## Agents

HASH [agents](/guide/agents) are AI agents which work for you. They perform tasks on your behalf, helping grow your web with useful information, and keep it up to date.

You can ask also ask your agent questions about the data in your web, helping you find and use relevant information more effectively.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<BullsEyeIcon />}>

## Goals

Agents can be given [goals](/guide/agents/goals). When provided with a goal, available agents will analyze your aims, develop a plan, and execute it autonomously upon your behalf, much as a capable human colleague might.

Right now, HASH supports **research and analysis** goals, helping you capture and process information about the world.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<InfinityIcon />}>

## Flows

Agents can also reliably and automatically execute sequences of steps, known [flows](/guide/flows). In contrast to goals, the actions involved in a flow are predefined ahead of time.

Flows can be triggered on-demand, in response to observed events, or on a recurring schedule.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<InboxIcon />}>

## Inbox

Your [inbox](/guide/inbox) contains notifications, messages, and actions (including drafts).

For example, if an agent requires you to clarify some part of a stated goal, a question from it will appear here.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<PlugRegularIcon />}>

## Plugins

[Plugins](/guide/plugins) allow you to interact with your web within other applications, and typically provide HASH with additional capabilities.

For example, installing the [HASH browser extension](/download) lets you (optionally) allow your agents to browse websites using any accounts you may be logged into. This can let them bypass paywalls, and access other protected content, exclusively on your behalf.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

# Other features

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<SyncIcon />}>

## Integrations

[Integrations](/guide/integrations) enable HASH to act on your behalf in external applications, and make it easy to sync data with your web.

Existing data sources can be connected to HASH, and the information within them represented as entities in your web, which are kept up-to-date in realtime.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<KeyIcon />}>

## Permissions

Every entity and type has a set of [permissions](/guide/webs/permissions) you can control, which govern what other users can both see and do.

Permissions can be managed very granularly, allowing view, update, comment, share and other forms of access to be restricted only to authorized users.

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper boxContent={<ShareIcon />}>

## Sharing

[Sharing](/guide/sharing) allows you to make select entities, types, or portions of your web available to others. You can also jointly manage **shared webs** with others, through [organizations](/guide/webs/orgs).

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper isUltra boxContent={<PageIcon />}>

## Pages

[Pages](/guide/pages) provide a way of using your entities, in HASH. Pages are created inside of each web you belong to (i.e. your own personal web, or the shared web of any organizations you're a member of), and will appear in your left-hand sidebar inside of HASH.

There are two types of pages in HASH:

- [Documents](/guide/pages/documents): linear pages where blocks are arranged in columns; typically used for text-heavy pages
- [Canvases](/guide/pages/canvases): free-form pages where blocks can be arranged spatially on an infinite canvas; useful for mindmaps, flowcharts, dashboards, and app-building

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper isUltra boxContent={<CubeIcon />}>

## Blocks

[Blocks](/guide/pages/blocks) can be inserted into pages, and provide many different kinds of functionality. For example:

- the Paragaph block lets you type (or see) some text, depending on whether you have edit (or just view) permissions on a page
- the Image block similarly lets you edit, insert, or simply view a picture (depending again upon your permissions)
- the AI Image block lets you type in a prompt and actually generate an image, which is then saved and persisted on the page
- the Minesweeper block is just good fun

A block such as a button or dropdown may also be [interactive](/guide/pages/blocks#action), or offer complex functionality such as access to an AI chatbot.

If you're a web developer comfortable writing code, you can build and publish your own blocks, and use them inside of HASH, by following the guide in the [HASH developer docs](https://hash.dev/docs/blocks).

</ParagraphIconWrapper>

<ParagraphIconWrapper isUltra boxContent={<BrowserOutlinedIcon />}>

## Apps

[Apps](/guide/apps) are ready-made bundles of blocks, types and pages, which can be added to a web with one click. Apps can also be created in a "no-code" manner by combining the same elements, and in the future will be publishable to a HASH App Store.
