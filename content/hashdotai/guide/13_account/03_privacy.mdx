# Overview

HASH supports both public and fully private usage, fitting any set of neeeds. This is true whether you're using the hosted version of HASH at [hash.ai](https://app.hash.ai/) or the self-hosted version locally or on your own servers.

## Profile visibility

Anybody with access to a HASH instance (such as the global instance hosted at **hash.ai**) can view the profiles of users who have accounts on that instance. For example, the profile of HASH's CEO can be found at [hash.ai/@d](https://app.hash.ai/@d). Profiles always include your **name** (e.g. `Dei Vilkinsons`), **username** (e.g. `@d`), and **avatar** (profile picture), alongside any other optional information you choose to appear, including:

- **Shared webs**: Any [shared webs](/guide/webs#shared-webs) you're a member of, where your membership visibility is set to "public", will appear on your profile. Please note: organizations with **Ultra** subscriptions to HASH may enforce whether members of their webs have publicly visible (or private-only) membership and in such cases you may not be able to control whether or not their icon(s) appear on your profile.
- **Pinned types**: Up to five types can be pinned to your profile and made publicly visible; additional types may be added which are only visible to certain kinds of other users — for example, colleagues or family members who have mutual access to a shared web.
- **Website URL**: A link to an external webpage (e.g. a personal blog, portfolio, or website) can be added.
- **Location**: A physical location (e.g. `London, UK`) can be added to your profile, helping other users know where you are.
- **Social media**: Icons linking to social media accounts you've connected to HASH may be shown, letting others find you elsewhere around the web.

Because viewing a HASH profile requires the ability to view a HASH instance, if you were to host HASH yourself locally (i.e. on your own computer without exposing it to the internet) only you would be able to see your profile page.

## Content visibility

Both [types](/guide/types) and [entities](/guide/entities) you create can be either public or private. In addition, they can be [shared](/guide/sharing) with specific users or organizations.

### Default visibility

By default: **types** you create are _public_, while **entities** are private to members of a web. This lets users build on and use each others' definitions of things (types) and develop a shared understanding of the attributes of them that are of mutual interest, without exposing any underlying data (entities).

### Type visibility

</Callout>

From time-to-time you may wish to work on types that you keep private. For example:

- **Types of a personal nature:** related to hobbies or interests you'd rather not make public;
- **Types that are commercially-sensitiive:** publishing certain types might reveal something unintended about your work, or a project that's in-progress.
- **Types that are "under construction":** sometimes, you may simply not yet be ready to make a type public yet, while it is edited and refined.

While types _themselves_ don't contain sensitive information relating to individual entities, their mere existence in a web might be used to infer interest in a thing. For example, if a company were to create a public `Acquisition Target` type in their web, an observant third-party may reasonably assume they are engaged in M&A activity, without necessarily being able to ascertain who they are targeting (although in a small industry there may be limited choices, or in combination with other types this may be inferable).

Entities can be made public or private at any time.
