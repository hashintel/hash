In **healthcare**, the volume and variety of data are enormous – electronic health records, lab results, medical imaging, genomics, drug databases, research publications, clinical guidelines, etc. These datasets often exist in isolation, making it difficult to get a comprehensive view of a patient or to discover insights across studies. Knowledge graphs (KGs) can integrate and harmonize this fragmented data into a single connected structure.

# Applications

## Patient Care & Clinical Decision Support

For example, imagine a hospital that collects data on patient records, diagnoses, treatments, medications, and lab results. Using a knowledge graph, the hospital can create a network that links all these pieces. It can connect a patient’s medical **history** with their current **symptoms**, recent **lab test** results, and prescribed **treatments**, all as interconnected nodes and relationships. With this unified view, the hospital’s systems (or caregivers) can infer valuable insights: identifying patterns in patient conditions and treatments to improve diagnostic accuracy, recommending personalized treatment plans tailored to an individual’s specific combination of conditions, and analyzing the effectiveness of different medications based on patient outcomes). In short, a healthcare knowledge graph enables a true **360-degree view of patient care**, where every relevant piece of information is connected. This leads to better clinical decision support – for instance, alerting doctors to potential drug interactions by seeing that two medications a patient is on are linked in the graph as having an adverse interaction.

## Medical Research & Development

Beyond direct patient care, knowledge graphs are proving invaluable in medical research and drug discovery. Researchers build specialized biomedical KGs that connect diseases to genes, proteins, drugs, phenotypes, and more. By mining these connections with AI algorithms, they can generate hypotheses for drug repurposing or identify new targets for therapy. A notable example is **PrimeKG**, a comprehensive disease-centric biomedical knowledge graph assembled from many primary data sources (including disease–gene associations, drug–target databases, and medical ontologies). PrimeKG enabled sophisticated analytics that would have been impossible otherwise – for instance, in one study it helped researchers identify 11 existing drugs that [could potentially be repurposed](https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/2023/12/21/knowledge-graphs-can-move-healthcare-into-the-future/#:~:text=Since%20developing%20KGs%20of%20this,drugs%20that%20could%20be%20repurposed) to treat other conditions, out of a set of 40 recently FDA-approved drugs. This kind of outcome highlights how connecting disparate biomedical knowledge into a graph can directly fuel innovation and discovery.

## Predictive Modeling & Explainability

Another emerging application is using KGs to tap into the latent knowledge in **electronic health records (EHRs)**. EHRs contain a wealth of patient information, but much of it is unstructured text (doctors’ notes) and hard to analyze at scale. By building a knowledge graph from EHR data – extracting key entities like conditions, procedures, medications and linking them – hospitals can start to detect patterns that help in predictive modeling. For instance, a KG built from EHRs can help predict patient risks by recognizing a constellation of past events (medical history) that collectively increase the risk of a certain outcome. This can feed into machine learning models for risk scoring or clinical decision support, making those models more **explainable** because the graph provides a reasoning trail (“Patient X is at high risk because they have condition A, which is related to factor B and C in the knowledge graph, which in past data led to outcome Z”).

# About Healthcare KGs

## Technical implementation

It’s worth noting that many healthcare KGs rely on **semantic graph** approaches (RDF/OWL) because of the need for standardized terminologies (like [SNOMED CT](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct) for clinical terms, or various disease ontologies). This allows integration of data from research and clinic using common identifiers. For example, linking a clinical diagnosis to a research knowledge base requires that both use the same ontology for diseases. Semantic interoperability is crucial in healthcare, and KGs provide the framework to achieve it. Mayo Clinic, for instance, is actively exploring knowledge graphs to unify genomics, proteomics, clinical data and more, aiming to enable personalized medicine; they emphasize that understanding connections between diseases, genes, drugs, and phenotypes could open doors for research on disease mechanisms, drug repurposing, and combination therapies.

## Business value

Both the commercial and clinical benefits of knowledge graphs in healthcare are significant. They can improve patient outcomes by ensuring decisions are informed by *all* relevant data (no more data hidden in separate silos). They can drive efficiencies by automating data integration tasks and reducing manual search – a doctor or a researcher can query the knowledge graph and quickly retrieve connected information that would have taken hours of cross-referencing otherwise. They also enable advanced analytics (like finding similar patient profiles for research or trials). Ultimately, this leads to better care, faster research breakthroughs, and potentially cost savings by catching issues (like adverse drug interactions or unnecessary tests) early through the connected knowledge. The main challenges in healthcare KGs are ensuring data privacy and security (patient data is sensitive), and the significant effort required to curate and maintain high-quality medical knowledge graphs. However, as the healthcare sector embraces AI, knowledge graphs are increasingly seen as a key to providing the *context* and *domain knowledge* that purely data-driven algorithms lack, thus moving healthcare into a more intelligent, knowledge-driven future.
