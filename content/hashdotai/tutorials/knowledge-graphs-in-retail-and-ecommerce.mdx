Retailers and e-commerce platforms deal with diverse data about products, customers, and their interactions. Knowledge graphs are helping these companies better organize their knowledge about products and better serve their customers through recommendations and improved search.

# Applications

## Product recommendation and personalization

Companies like Amazon, eBay, and Netflix use knowledge graph concepts to enhance their recommendation engines. Netflix, for instance, famously utilizes knowledge graphs to underpin its ‘spookily accurate’ content recommendation system, linking movies, shows, actors, genres, user profiles, and viewing history. By creating a web of connections – e.g., a user is linked to the shows they watched, those shows are linked to genres and actors, which link to other shows – Netflix can go beyond simple collaborative filtering. The knowledge graph allows Netflix to find, say, that a user likes *“crime drama series with a strong female lead”* even if that’s not an explicit category, because the graph connects those concepts through various nodes (perhaps the user liked **Mindhunter** and **Broadchurch**, which share certain thematic tags or crew, thus the graph can suggest another show with overlapping elements). These associations help anticipate what the customer might like to watch next. The result is a more accurate and *explainable* recommendation: the system could even surface *why* it recommended something (e.g., “because you watched X” and there’s a path in the graph from X to the recommended item).

In e-commerce, a knowledge graph of products can capture relationships like *“bought together”*, *“is variant of”*, *“compatible with”*, or *“replacement for”*. For example, an online electronics retailer might have a graph linking a camera to its compatible lenses, accessories, and successor models. If a shopper looks at that camera, the system can easily find all related items and either recommend them or ensure search results include those connections. This improves cross-selling and upselling opportunities. eBay has been building a knowledge graph that maps relationships between products and the way users interact with them. This can help with search relevance (understanding that a search for “Apple phone 2019 model” should match an iPhone 11, for instance, which is knowledge encoded in the graph as an alias or attribute of that product).

## Customer insights and marketing

Retailers also use knowledge graphs to better understand customer behavior. By linking customer profiles with their purchase history, browsing history, customer service interactions, and even social media feedback, a retailer can query the graph to answer questions like “what other products are my VIP customers likely to buy?” or “which segments of customers are related to this new product line’s target market?”. One benefit is in marketing: a knowledge graph can reveal non-obvious connections that inform more targeted campaigns. For instance, if a fashion retailer’s KG shows that people who buy a certain sneaker brand also tend to buy a specific style of jacket, marketing can use that insight to bundle promotions or tailor advertisements. By understanding customer behavior better through a KG, marketers can create more powerful, targeted campaigns and even identify product design improvements from feedback relationships.

## Search and discovery

Many e-commerce sites implement **semantic search** backed by a knowledge graph. Instead of purely keyword-based search, the graph helps interpret the intent. If a user searches for “summer cocktail dress under $100”, a knowledge graph-enhanced search can understand “cocktail dress” is a category and “summer” implies certain styles or materials, and then filter by price, returning a much more precise set of results. The KG might encode that *Cocktail Dress* is a type of *Dress*, which has attributes like seasonality and price. This is similar to how Google’s semantic search works, where the KG helps understand entities and relationships behind the query. On a retailer’s site, semantic search can significantly enhance user experience by allowing more natural queries and by showing rich information (for example, typing a product name might show a quick info panel of the product specs – powered by the KG – before the user even clicks anything).

## Inventory and supply optimization

Retail and supply chain overlap; a retailer might also use a knowledge graph for managing store inventories, connecting products to warehouses to shipments to stores. This is more on the operational side, but it’s worth noting as a use case – some large retailers treat their operations as a graph problem to optimize routing and restocking.

# Benefits

For retail and e-commerce, knowledge graphs drive **revenue growth** and **customer satisfaction**. Better recommendations and search lead to more sales and happier customers who find what they need. Graph-based personalization often outperforms simpler methods because it can leverage a wider context. Also, a knowledge graph provides a **unified knowledge base** of products and customer relationships that can be reused across applications (recommendation, search, analytics), reducing duplication and ensuring consistency in information (e.g., if a product is discontinued, updating the KG ensures all downstream apps “know” about it). Retailers also benefit from the agility – as product lines change or new trends emerge (say a new category like “smart home devices”), adding that concept to the graph and linking products to it can be faster than reworking a rigid database schema.

A challenge in retail KGs is data volume (for a large catalog and user base, the graph gets huge) and keeping it updated in real-time with new user interactions. But modern graph databases and streaming ingestion techniques have been scaling to meet these needs. Another challenge is making sure the graph is cleaned and normalized – product data especially can be messy (different naming conventions, etc.), so building a high-quality product knowledge graph might involve significant data cleansing and consolidation effort. Many retailers find the investment worth it, as the KG becomes a cornerstone for AI-driven features (recommendations, chatbots, etc.) that are essential in today’s competitive marketplace.
