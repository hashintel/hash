## What is a DAG?

A Directed Acyclic Graph (or _DAG_) is a special type of graph made up of nodes (also known as _vertices_), and edges, in which:

1. all edges have a direction associated with them, and
1. the graph as a whole contains no cycles (aka. _loops_).

The below figure illustrates a classic DAG, in which all nodes are connected by at least one directional edge, and all pathways lead to a single end-state.

## Uses of DAGs in Data Science

In data applications like [HASH](/platform), DAGs are commonly used to illustrate:

- **[data pipelines](/glossary/data-pipelines):** the decision and processing steps taken as data flows through a pipeline
- **schedules:** any system of tasks with ordering constraints (not just a data pipeline) can be illustrated with a DAG
- **dependency/citation graphs:** a list of dependencies or citations that allows the provenance of work to be tracked

## More information

In mathematical terms, DAGs are a specific subclass of **oriented graphs** (graphs without bidirectional edges). Ultimately though, you don’t have to understand the technical ins and outs of DAGs in order to utilize them as part of a data pipeline.

Modern data engineering tools such as [hCore](/platform/core) abstract away complexity through simple, easy-to-use interfaces that provide prompts and feedback, preventing the creation of malformed DAGs (for example, those which may inadvertently contain circular loops or cycles).
