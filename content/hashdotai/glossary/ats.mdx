Applicant Tracking Systems are applications which help employers manage recruitment and hiring operations. They function as a single source of information, storing data submitted by the applicant as well as notes and feedback captured by the hiring and interview teams. Many ATS solutions also provide communication capabilities through the application, and will also improve the process from the applicantâ€™s end by providing streamlined and clear interfaces for submitting resumes and other employer-requested information.

ATS track applicants through the hiring process, helping recruiting ops teams schedule interviews, organize and filter interviewer feedback, manage communications with candidates, and eventually track offer acceptances or rejections. As these services have developed they have also incorporated more artificial intelligence techniques, primarily Natural Language Processing which can perform initial screenings of applications (e.g. by searching for key words or phrases).

Applicant tracking systems are increasingly serving as data sources to power models and simulations to inform strategic HR decisions.
