Attributes describe [entities](/glossary/entities) and are either [properties](/glossary/properties) or [links](/glossary/links).

The attributes that exist on an entity are determined by an [entity's type](/glossary/entity-types), which in turn defines what kinds of properties and links can be associated with it (through [property types](/glossary/property-types) and [link types](/glossary/link-types)).

A single entity can be of more than one entity type. For example, a `Person` entity might also be an `Employee`, allowing specific employment-related information to be stored in conjunction with a person's record in HASH.
