## What are integrations?

Integrations allow information from one system to be either pulled or pushed into another, and actions to be taken automatically in response to that information.

For example, job `Candidate` entities from an [applicant tracking system](/glossary/ats) may be automatically converted into `Employee` entities within a [project management software](/glossary/project-management-software) package when a job offer is extended and accepted by a candidate.

## Coming soon to HASH

In the context of HASH, our forthcoming integrations feature will enable data to be read from – and in some cases written back out to – a wide range of 3rd-party services.

Data obtained through integrations will also be automatically transformable within HASH through autosuggested and user-defined [data pipeline 'flows'](/glossary/data-pipelines), which map 3rd-party data to [schemas](/glossary/schemas) and allow their property values to be [automatically enriched](/glossary/values#automated-enrichment). Flows may also be used to trigger events in HASH, as well as a small number of supported external applications. This makes it possible to build complex workflows that integrate with your existing tooling and SaaS applications. Our goal is to enable continued use of best-in-class external services while ultimately mapping the data within those applications to normalized constructs that can be rendered and interacted with through [blocks](/glossary/blocks) and flows.
