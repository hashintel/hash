Diffs are used to track changes between two different versions or [forks](/glossary/fork) of a project.

A diff provides a list of what files have been changed, and what changes have occurred. For example, a new file might have been created, another deleted, and the contents of a third modified.

Command-line Git software and clients often contain built-in tools for diffing. [HASH](/platform) contains these built-in, removing the need for additional external tooling:

- Line-by-line diffing is automatically conducted as part of the [merge process](/glossary/merge) in HASH.
- When you upgrade individual behaviors or other dependencies in the [hCore](/platform/core) editor, you may see a “diff view” highlighting what’s new and updated in an upgraded version of a file.
