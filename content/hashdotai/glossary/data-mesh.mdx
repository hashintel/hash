A data mesh is a new paradigm for data management. Unlike existing data platforms that focus on centralizing and unifying data, a data mesh emphasizes decentralization of data control and management, with each team or domain handling and serving data products. Its analogous to a micro services architecture in web development; instead of a monolithic data warehouse serving all of the data, teams provide their own data products. The teams have ownership over the scope of the data and governance, providing them through APIs and discoverability services. The potential of data meshes is greater flexibility and a devolution of authority and responsibility to the data owners, ensuring that the teams best placed to maintain data sources do.
