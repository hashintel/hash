## What are values?

Values are the information contained within a single [property](/glossary/properties) on a specific instance of an [entity](/glossary/entities).

**For example:** consider the `@schema/Person` entity type, and an instance of it. We’ll call this entity `Alex`.

- One of the properties that our entity type `@schema/Person` expects is `jobTitle`.
- Alex is a pastry chef.
- Where the property `jobTitle` appears on our entity, `Alex`, its value may be set to "Pastry Chef".

## Manual enrichment

If you have two [datasets](/glossary/datasets) containing overlapping entities, but mismatching property values, you can merge these upon importing them in [HASH](/platform/hash).

You can also manually enter values into entity’s properties by hand. For some entity types, specific [blocks](/glossary/blocks) exist which assist in the process of efficiently capturing this information.

## Automated enrichment

Through HASH’s forthcoming [integrations](/glossary/integrations) feature you’ll be automatically able to keep entity’s properties in sync with other applications and databases you already use.

## Third-party lookup enrichment

If an entity’s properties are properly [typed](/glossary/types), it may be possible to automatically infer their values by checking them against external providers of data.

For example, there are services which when provided with:

- an **email address** -- will attempt to return the name of the account holder, and their social media account usernames;
- an **IP address** -- will return the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and approximate geographic location;
- a **credit card number** -- will return the issuing bank, type of card, etc.

In the future you will be able to perform third-party lookup enrichment directly within HASH, making it easy to construct and maintain a high-quality, up-to-date graph.
