In both programming and mathematics, **variables** are abstract things which can contain information, and which have a symbolic name by which they can be referred.

In HASH, any [property](/glossary/properties) or [link](/glossary/links) may be used as a variable in an equation, or by an application querying a [web](/guide/webs) via the HASH API.
