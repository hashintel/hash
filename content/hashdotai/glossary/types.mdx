## What are types?

Types provide us with the ability to describe the form or “shape” we expect information to be in.

Four sorts of **types** exist in HASH:

1. **Entity** types
1. **Link** types
1. **Property** types
1. **Data** types

A type is something that defines the rules and constraints associated with one of the above ([entities](/glossary/entities), [links](/glossary/links), [properties](/glossary/properties), or [data values](/glossary/values)).

**Casual users of HASH may never need to know about or create/edit types at all.** However, as you customize your workspace and hope to get more out of it, you may want to familiarize yourself with entity types, to represent the types of things you care about more exactly. As time goes on, you can learn more about link, property and data types – although these are typically only touched by more advanced users of HASH.

## More about types

### Entity types

We describe entity types in detail on the [entity types](/glossary/entity-types) page.

### Link types

Link types are described on the [links](/glossary/links#link-types) page.

### Property types

Property types are described on the [properties](/glossary/properties#property-types) page.

### Data types

Data types are detailed on the [data types](/glossary/data-types) page.
