description: Create and manage Claude Code skills in HASH repository following Anthropic best practices. Use when creating new skills, modifying skill-rules.json, understanding trigger patterns, working with hooks, debugging skill activation, or implementing progressive disclosure. Covers skill structure, YAML frontmatter, trigger types (keywords, intent patterns), UserPromptSubmit hook, and the 500-line rule. Includes validation and debugging with SKILL_DEBUG. Examples include rust-error-stack, cargo-dependencies, and rust-documentation skills.

# Writing Claude Code Skills for HASH

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing skills in Claude Code with auto-activation system, following Anthropic's official best practices including the 500-line rule and progressive disclosure pattern.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:

- Creating or adding skills
- Modifying skill triggers or rules
- Understanding how skill activation works
- Debugging skill activation issues
- Working with skill-rules.json
- Hook system mechanics
- Claude Code best practices
- Progressive disclosure
- YAML frontmatter
- 500-line rule

---

## System Overview

### Current Implementation

**UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Suggestions)

- **File**: `.claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts`
- **Trigger**: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt
- **Purpose**: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns
- **Method**: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout → Claude's input)
- **Use Cases**: Topic-based skills, implicit work detection
- **Debug**: Run with `SKILL_DEBUG=true` to see matching logic
- **Validation**: Run with `--validate` flag to check configuration

### Configuration File

**Location**: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`

Defines:

- All skills and their trigger conditions
- Enforcement levels (currently only `"suggest"` is implemented)
- Keyword triggers (exact substring matching)
- Intent pattern triggers (regex matching)

---

## Skill Types

### Domain Skills (Currently Implemented)

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive guidance for specific areas

**Characteristics:**

- Type: `"domain"`
- Enforcement: `"suggest"` (advisory, non-blocking)
- Priority: `"high"` or `"medium"`
- Activated by keyword or intent pattern matching
- Topic or domain-specific
- Comprehensive documentation with progressive disclosure

**Examples in HASH:**

- `rust-error-stack` - Error handling with error-stack crate
- `cargo-dependencies` - Cargo.toml dependency management patterns
- `rust-documentation` - Rust doc comment best practices
- `writing-skills` - This skill! Meta-guidance for creating skills

**When to Use:**

- Complex systems requiring deep knowledge
- Best practices documentation
- Architectural patterns
- How-to guides

### Future: Guardrail Skills (Not Yet Implemented)

Guardrail skills with blocking enforcement (`"block"`) are designed but not yet implemented. These would enforce critical patterns and prevent common mistakes.

---

## Quick Start: Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create Skill File

**Location:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

**Template:**

```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description including keywords that trigger this skill. Mention topics, file types, and use cases. Be explicit about trigger terms.
---

# My New Skill

## Purpose
What this skill helps with

## When to Use
Specific scenarios and conditions

## Key Information
The actual guidance, documentation, patterns, examples
```

**Best Practices:**

- ✅ **Name**: Lowercase, hyphens, gerund form (verb + -ing) preferred
- ✅ **Description**: Include ALL trigger keywords/phrases (max 1024 chars)
- ✅ **Content**: Under 500 lines - use reference files for details
- ✅ **Examples**: Real code examples
- ✅ **Structure**: Clear headings, lists, code blocks

### Step 2: Add to skill-rules.json

See [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) for complete schema.

**Basic Template:**

```json
{
  "my-new-skill": {
    "type": "domain",
    "enforcement": "suggest",
    "priority": "medium",
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "intentPatterns": ["(create|add).*?something"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test and Validate

**Test with specific prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/hooks
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"your test prompt","cwd":".","permission_mode":"auto","transcript_path":""}' | \
  npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

**Validate configuration:**

```bash
cd .claude/hooks
npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts --validate
```

**Debug matching logic:**

```bash
cd .claude/hooks
export SKILL_DEBUG=true
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"your test prompt","cwd":".","permission_mode":"auto","transcript_path":""}' | \
  npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

### Step 4: Refine Patterns

Based on testing:

- Add missing keywords that should trigger the skill
- Refine intent patterns to reduce false positives
- Use word boundaries in regex: `\\b(keyword)\\b` instead of just `keyword`

### Step 5: Follow Anthropic Best Practices

✅ Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
✅ Use progressive disclosure with reference files
✅ Add table of contents to reference files > 100 lines
✅ Write detailed description with trigger keywords
✅ Test with 3+ real scenarios before documenting
✅ Iterate based on actual usage

---

## Current Implementation Details

### Enforcement

Currently only **SUGGEST** enforcement is implemented:

- Suggestion injected before Claude sees prompt via UserPromptSubmit hook
- Claude becomes aware of relevant skills
- Not enforced or blocking - purely advisory
- All existing skills use this pattern

**Future:** Blocking enforcement (`"block"`) and warning enforcement (`"warn"`) are designed in the schema but not yet implemented.

### Debugging and Validation

**Environment Variables:**

- `SKILL_DEBUG=true` - Show detailed matching logic to stderr
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - Override project directory (auto-detected if not set)

**Validation Command:**

```bash
npx tsx .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts --validate
```

Shows:

- Project directory
- Rules file location
- Configured skills with trigger counts
- Verification that SKILL.md files exist

## Quick Reference Summary

### Create New Skill (5 Steps)

1. Create `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Add entry to `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`
3. Test with `npx tsx` commands
4. Refine patterns based on testing
5. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines

### Trigger Types (Currently Implemented)

- **Keywords**: Explicit topic mentions (substring matching)
- **Intent**: Implicit action detection (regex patterns)

See [trigger-types.md](resources/trigger-types.md) for complete details.

### Enforcement (Current)

- **SUGGEST**: Inject context before prompt - only implemented enforcement level
- **BLOCK/WARN**: Designed but not yet implemented

### Debugging

- `SKILL_DEBUG=true` - Show detailed matching logic
- `--validate` flag - Validate configuration
- Check `.claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts` for implementation

### Anthropic Best Practices

✅ **500-line rule**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Use reference files for details
✅ **Table of contents**: Add to reference files > 100 lines
✅ **One level deep**: Don't nest references deeply
✅ **Rich descriptions**: Include all trigger keywords (max 1024 chars)
✅ **Test first**: Build 3+ evaluations before extensive documentation
✅ **Gerund naming**: Prefer verb + -ing (e.g., "processing-pdfs")

### Troubleshoot

Test hooks manually:

```bash
# Test with prompt
cd .claude/hooks
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"test","cwd":".","permission_mode":"auto","transcript_path":""}' | \
  npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts

# Validate configuration
npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts --validate

# Debug matching
SKILL_DEBUG=true echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"test","cwd":".","permission_mode":"auto","transcript_path":""}' | \
  npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

See [troubleshooting.md](resources/troubleshooting.md) for complete debugging guide.
