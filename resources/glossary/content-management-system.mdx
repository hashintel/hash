Applications used to manage web content are known as Content Management Systems. They allow users to create, manage, and modify content being displayed on a website. These are typically collaborative, allowing multiple users or teams to be responsible for their own content.

Content management systems typically provide two main features: a Content Delivery System and a Content Management Application. The first provides infrastructure to host and render a website, while the second provides a user interface to generate, upload, and modify the content. The management interface generally provides document and digital asset management. Document management allows users to write and format text content, while digital asset management provides functionality to store and display images, videos, and other file types.

CMSs may be used to power public-facing websites or internal knowledge-bases, wikis and intranets. Traditional CMSs are often static, requiring human management and intervention in order to keep content up to date. Using a HASH graph as a “headless” CMS can allow for more efficient, accurate and timely delivery of information to end-users - ensuring information, wherever it is displayed, reflects an organization’s up-to-date understanding of a problem space, environment, or it’s parameters.
