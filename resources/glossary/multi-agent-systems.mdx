Multi-agent systems are computational structures made up of multiple intelligent agents who can process information, interact with their environment, and with other agents. Multi-agent systems can represent many different real-world systems: transportation, healthcare, and networking are just a few examples.

The agents in MAS must typically meet a number of criteria:
- Self-aware: agents are aware of their own internal state (properties)
- Autonomous: agents determine their own actions, instead of being fully controlled by a central source
- Limited information: agents are aware of their “local” environment (defined by the model) instead of having full knowledge of the system

Agents can have various degrees and structures of “intelligence”, in the form of hard-coded logic, utility-maximizing functions, or neural networks.

[Agent-Based Models (ABM)](https://hash.ai/glossary/agent-based-modeling) are closely related to Multi-Agent Systems, but are differentiated by their goals. The development of an ABM is typically for explaining or demonstrating certain existing phenomena as a result of collective agent behavior, as opposed to a MAS where the primary goal is designing agents which can solve a specific problem. Because of this, ABM agents are typically simpler and fully homogeneous.
