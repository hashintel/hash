Properties store individual pieces of information about [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities) as [values](https://hash.ai/glossary/values). All properties on an entity are inferred from its [entity type(s)](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types).

Property values (the contents of a property field) can either be **required** or **optional**. In either case, marking a property as required or not will be specified on the thing _using the property_ (e.g. the entity type which requires the property) rather than on the property itself.

## Property types

A **property type** is how a property is defined. It can be used by one or more entity types, or _other_ property types. A property type:

- defines the `name` of the property;
- contains an optional `description` that explains in human-readable terms what that property represents; and
- contains information about what the property’s value is expected to look like, either through reference to [data types](https://hash.ai/glossary/data-types) or other property types.
