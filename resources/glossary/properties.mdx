Property fields (also known as "properties") store individual pieces of information about [entities](https://hash.ai/glossary/entities) as [values](https://hash.ai/glossary/values). All property fields on an entity are inferred from its [entity type(s)](https://hash.ai/glossary/entity-types).

Property values (the contents of a property field) can either be **required** or **optional**. In either case, that information will be attached to the thing _using the property_ (e.g. the entity type which requires the property) rather than on the property itself. 

## Property types

A **property type** is a definition of a property used by one or more entity types, or _other_ property types. A property type:

- defines the `name` of the property;
- contains an optional `description` that explains in human-readable terms what that property represents; and
- contains information about what the propertyâ€™s value is expected to look like, either through reference to [data types](https://hash.ai/glossary/data-types) or other property types.
