The term digital twin (sometimes used interchangeably with "synthetic environment") refers to an in-silico, computer simulated analogue to a real-world system. It is often used to describe computer simulations that mirror real-world biological systems, architectural spaces, as well as factory/warehouses. These simulations can be used to generate [synthetic data](https://hash.ai/glossary/synthetic-data-generation), perform low-cost tradespace analyses by modifying the digital system, and generate risk assessments by introducing simulated stochastic failures, among other things.

HASH allows for real-time sensor and other streaming data, as well as static datasets and domain expert assumptions to be layered into digital twins in order to ensure they remain up to date. Digital twins are very valuable in the warehousing and manufacturing industries, as well as any other industry where real-world experiments with strategy or layout changes are very costly.
