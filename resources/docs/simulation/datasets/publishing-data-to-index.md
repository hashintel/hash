# Publishing Datasets

You can share your datasets with others by publishing them to hIndex.

To publish a Dataset, visit your profile, select the data you want to publish, and click Edit Project.

![Publish Datasets](../.gitbook/assets/data_publish.webp)

From the Edit Project modal add descriptions, keywords, and schemas to your data.

![Publish Modal](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-12-at-1.22.27-pm.png)

Release a new version and click public at the bottom of the modal.

Finally add semantic versioning details and create a release.

If publishing as yourself, the dataset will be referenced in a simulation as:

```text
"@[your-username]/[listing-shortname]/[dataset].[csv/json]"
```

Or, if you're part of an organization and publishing on their behalf, when you publish a dataset in a simulation it will be referenceable as:

```text
"@[org-handle]/[listing-shortname]/[dataset].[csv/json]"
```
