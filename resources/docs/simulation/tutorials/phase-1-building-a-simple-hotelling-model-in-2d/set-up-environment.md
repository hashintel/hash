# Environment Setup

After opening up a new simulation in HASH, navigate to globals.json. First, we are going to set up the [**Topology**](/docs/simulation/configuration/topology), or the environment, of the model.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="globals.json" >

```javascript
{
  "topology": {
    "x_bounds": [
      0,
      10
    ],
    "y_bounds": [
      0,
      10
    ],
    "search_radius": 15
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Setting the x_bounds and y_bounds creates a 10x10 boundary within the environment which will be used to generate the customer and business agents. This code also sets the search_radius of all agents in the simulation to 15, which will automatically update an agentâ€™s neighbor list to include all agents within a distance of 15.
