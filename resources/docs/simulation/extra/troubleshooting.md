If you're looking for help with debugging simulation logic, head over to [debugging](troubleshooting-2/).

### What to try if you encounter a crash

We hope you never see hCore crash. But if you do, there are a few things you can try.

1. **Refresh the page**  This will usually do the trick. 
2. **Clear your browser cache \(saved data\)** Sometimes the files or configuration details that hCore depends on get into a weird state and need to be reset. You can read how to do this on [Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache), [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4). Note that this can also clear saved passwords and other data, so check any settings in the process carefully.  You can also **try opening a private/incognito window first** - if it works there, clearing your browser cache is likely to make it work in a regular window. 
3. **Try a different browser** Some errors are specific to certain browsers or browser versions. 
4. **Close other browser windows or browser tabs** Some errors are caused by resources being unavailable, and closing other browser windows can help free them up. If the error details mention __memory or WebGL this may help. For errors relating to WebGL \(which renders graphics\), [you can also check your browser's support here](https://get.webgl.org/). 
5. **Contact us** Please [contact us](https://hash.ai/contact) if you have trouble recovering from a crash, if you encounter them repeatedly, or if there is other useful information we could add to this page.
