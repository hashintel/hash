# Overview

Welcome to [HASH](https://hash.ai), an end-to-end solution for quickly creating massive, rich, real-time simulations.

You can use HASH to build detailed, agent based simulations of [factory floors](https://hash.ai/@hash/warehouse-conveyor1), [business processes](https://hash.ai/@hash/interconnected-call-center), [public policy decisions](https://hash.ai/@b/sir-infection-network-w-rapid-tests), or really any other type of complex system.

## Getting Started

<Hint style="success">
As a new user, the best way to learn HASH is to [read up on the basics of agent-based modeling](https://docs.hash.ai/core/creating-simulations/agent-based-modeling-basics-1) and [agents](https://docs.hash.ai/core/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent), and try your hand at the [Tutorials](https://docs.hash.ai/core/tutorials/). You can also browse [our own models](https://hash.ai/models?sort=popularity&query=%40hash) to find simulations with interesting dynamics you can tinker with and adapt for your own models.
</Hint>

If you've used simulation modeling software before, you might find that models in HASH are a little different to those you're used to seeing. We leverage composable [agents](creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/) and [behaviors](creating-simulations/behaviors/) to make it faster and easier for you to create realistic, well-calibrated simulations.

If you're new to agent-based modeling, or want to better understand how these concepts translate into HASH, read up on [the basics of agent-based modeling](creating-simulations/agent-based-modeling-basics-1.md).

If you want to experiment with pre-built models, check out our examples on the [hIndex](https://hash.ai/models?sort=popularity&query=%40hash) - or carry on reading to learn how to build your own.

## Community & Support
