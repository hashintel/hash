# Overview

[HASH](/) is an end-to-end solution for quickly creating massive, rich, real-time simulations.

You can use HASH's tools to build rich, detailed, agent-based simulations of [factory floors](/@hash/warehouse-conveyor1), [business processes](/@hash/interconnected-call-center), [public policy decisions](/@b/sir-infection-network-w-rapid-tests), or any other type of complex system you can imagine.

## Getting Started

<Hint style="success">
  
As a new user, the best way to learn HASH is to [read up on the basics of agent-based modeling](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/agent-based-modeling-basics-1) and [agents](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent), and try your hand at the [Tutorials](/docs/simulation/tutorials/hello-hash). You can also browse [our own models](/models?sort=popularity&query=%40hash) to find simulations with interesting dynamics you can tinker with and adapt for your own models.
  
</Hint>

If you've used simulation modeling software before, you might find that models in HASH are a little different to those you're used to seeing. We leverage composable [agents](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/) and [behaviors](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/behaviors/) to make it faster and easier for you to create realistic, well-calibrated simulations.

If you're new to agent-based modeling, or want to better understand how these concepts translate into HASH, read up on [the basics of agent-based modeling](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/agent-based-modeling-basics-1).

If you want to experiment with pre-built models, check out our examples on the [hIndex](/models?sort=popularity&query=%40hash) - or carry on reading to learn how to build your own.

## Community & Support

If you need help or support, check out the [support forum](https://hash.community/) or [join our community Discord](/discord) \(this tends to be the fastest means of getting help\). You can also reach out to us directly via our [contact page](https://hash.ai/contact).
