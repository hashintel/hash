# Agents

As the name suggests, **agents** lie at the heart of _agent_-_based_ modeling. Agents are made up of State, Behaviors, and Context.

Every agent has a name and a unique identifier. As a simulation creator, you can set and change the `agent_name` and you can set the `agent_id`before the agent is initialized, but you can't change the agent_id after the simulation has started.

<Hint style="info">

The HASH Engine by default will set the `agent_id`, so don't worry about setting it manually unless you have a particular need for an agent's id [value in the sim logic](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/libraries/hash/agent#generateagentid).

Naming your agent is entirely optional. The simplest possible agent is simply `{}` \(although it won't do much of anything!\)

An individual agent has a [state](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/state) and a [context](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/context).

When we define the [initial conditions](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/anatomy-of-an-agent/initial-state) of a simulation, we're defining the initial agents that will be present in the first timestep of the simulation, each of which will have its own state and context.
