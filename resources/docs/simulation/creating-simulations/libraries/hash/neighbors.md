# Neighbors

## `neighborsOnPosition(agentA, neighbors)`

This function returns all neighbors that share the same position as `agentA`. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

```javascript
function behavior(state, context) {
    // Find neighbors on my position
    const neighbors = context.neighbors();
    const cohabitators = hstd.neighborsOnPosition(state, neighbors);

    // Create an adjacent "agent"
    let adjPos = state.position;
    adjPos[0] + 1;
    const adjAgent = { "position": adjPos };

    // Find the agents adjacent to me
    const adjacents = hstd.neighborsOnPosition({ "position": adjPos }, neighbors);

    ...
}
```

## `neighborsInRadius(agentA, neighbors, max_radius, min_radius, z_axis)`

This function returns all neighbors within the specified radii. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well. By default the max and min radii are \[1, 0\]. `z_axis` is false by default, but by passing true you can enable search in a spherical, as opposed to circular radius.

```javascript
function behavior(state, context) {
    // Count the number of electrons close to me
    const electrons = context.neighbors().filter(n => n.agent_type === "electron");   
    const close_electrons = hstd.neighborsInRadius(state, electrons, 2, 0, true).length;

    ...
}
```

## `neighborsInFront(agentA, neighbors, colinear)`

This function returns all neighbors located in front of an agent. `agentA` must have a "direction" property since "in front" is determined by the plane perpendicular to that vector. `colinear` defaults to false, but by passing true the function will only return agents on the same _line_ as the "direction". The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

```javascript
function behavior(state, context) {
    const neighbors = context.neighbors();

    // Check which of my neighbors I can see "in front" of me
    const visibleAgents = hstd.neighborsInFront(state, neighbors);

    // Check which agents are in front of one of my neighbors
    const neighborFront = hstd.neighborsInFront(neighbors[0], neighbors);

    ...
}
```

## `neighborsBehind(agentA, neighbors, colinear)`

This function returns all neighbors located behind the agent. It functions identically to **neighborsInFront** but returns agents behind the plane of `agentA`. The current agent's `state` can be passed in as `agentA`, and dummy agents can be used as well.

```javascript
function behavior(state, context) {
    const neighbors = context.neighbors();

    // Check which of my neighbors are tailing me
    const tailingAgents = hstd.neighborsBehind(state, neighbors, true);

    // Check if my neighbor is being tailed
    const neighborTail = hstd.neighborsBehind(neighbors[0], neighbors, true);
    const neighborTailed = neighborTail.length > 0;

    ...
}
```
