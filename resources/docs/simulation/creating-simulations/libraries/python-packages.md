# Python

We run Python3 in the browser through [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) and [currently support all of the packages that Pyodide does](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages).

**The packages below have proven particularly popular with modelers using HASH:**

| [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.20/) | 0.20.1 | Machine Learning |
| [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.4/reference/) | 1.15.4 | Base library for scientific computing in Python |
| [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.1/reference/) | 0.17.1 | Optimization, linear algebra, and statistics |
