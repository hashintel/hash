# Activity History

When you make changes to files in a project, create a release, or run a simulation/experiment, HASH automatically records the action and output within the _Activity_ panel \(by default the right-hand sidebar in hCore\). You can revisit earlier versions of a project, view previously computed results, or re-run a simulation or experiment with its original values in order to reproduce the run.

![The Activity sidebar is on the right hand side of the IDE](https://cdn-us1.hash.ai/site/docs/image%20%2839%29.png)

You can also filter within the activity panel to show only events matching a specific type.
