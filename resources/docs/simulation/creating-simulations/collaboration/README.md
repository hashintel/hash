# Collaboration

HASH contains a number of features designed to support effective team collaboration when building simulation models and accessing their outputs.

## Issues

On every hIndex project page, you can browse or open new issues on projects to leave feedback, ask questions, or request changes.

## Releases

You can "cut a release" of any HASH project \(whether a simulation, behavior, dataset, or any other collection of files\) at any time. Releases are available for import within other HASH projects, allowing for high-degrees of collaboration and composability within HASH, without risking breakage from ongoing development-related changes to components.

## Organizations

In the same way you can create private projects as an individual user, visible only to you, by [creating an organization](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/collaboration/organizations) you can extend the right to view and edit a project to trusted teams of collaborators.

## Shareable links

Should you choose to allow it, projects in [hCore](/platform/core) can be shared with anybody, even if they don't have a HASH account, and opened directly in the browser -- no special software required.

To generate a share link, click the 'Share' button in the top-right hand corner of HASH. [Read more about sharing simulations &gt;](/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/collaboration/sharing-releasing)

## Coming soon

Other features coming soon include:

* Merge Requests in hCore and hIndex
* Google Docs-style editing history
* Real-time editing \(Google Docs-style\) - see other editors'
* Cross-team billing
* Shared storage and compute caps
* Single Sign-On \(SSO\)
