# Register for Access

HASH's three main APIs are now in development and testing.

## hCore API

The **hCore API** provides read and write access to the code and contents of simulation projects. This access can be used, amongst other things, to change the logic of a simulation based on external changes offline or in response to user-input outside of HASH. This unlocks the creation of domain-specific and custom user interfaces for building HASH models.

## hCloud API

The **hCloud API** provides access to the results of simulation and experiment runs executed on hCloud. This enables HASH simulations to be integrated into production decision-making or Machine Learning workflows.

## hIndex API

The **hIndex API** enables data and other projects contained within hIndex to be accessed and updated externally.
