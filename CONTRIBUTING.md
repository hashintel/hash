# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉 We've established a set of [community guidelines](https://hash.ai/legal/community) to enable as many people as possible to contribute to and benefit from HASH. Please follow these when interacting with this repo.

We have a community [Discord server](https://hash.ai/discord) and [support forum](https://hash.community/) where you can ask questions about contributing, and where the community can chime in with helpful advice. If you'd like to make a significant change or re-architecture, please first discuss the change there (or create an [issue](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/issues)) to get feedback before spending too much time.

## HASH Public Monorepo

This repository is HASH's public monorepo. It contains [several different](README.md) projects, some of which are open-source. Each project has its own [license](LICENSE.md) and contribution policies which may vary slightly.

To ascertain the license and contributor policy for a given project, check out the `LICENSE.md` and `CONTRIBUTOR.md` files in its root.

## Common contribution processes

These apply across all projects:

- Before undertaking any significant work, please share your proposal with us. You can do so as a [discussion](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/discussions) if it's a feature proposal, or an [issue](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/issues) if it's a bug you intend to fix. If you're unsure, you can always chat to us on [Discord](https://hash.ai/discord) first. If it's a typo or docs change, don't worry about this step.
- When submitting a pull request, please fill out any sections of the provided template you feel able to. If you are unsure or don't feel a section is relevant, please say so. Include a link to the issue or discussion proposing the change.
- Once you have receive a pull request review, please bear the following in mind:
  - reviewers may make suggestions for _optional_ changes which are not required to get your code merged. It should be obvious which suggestions are obvious, and which are required changes. If it is not obvious, ask for clarification.
  - please only resolve comment threads when it is obvious there is no scope for further discussion. If in doubt, leave them open. If comment threads discuss work to be done in follow up, always leave them open (so they can be directly linked to).

## Paid Roles

We're recruiting for a number of full-time roles. If you've already contributed to the open-source `hash` repo, mention this in your application. View our open roles at [hash.ai/careers](https://hash.ai/careers) and drop your name in the _General Pool_ even if you'd be happy to work on HASH, but can't see a good fit right now.
