This block typically allows the user to create a step-by-step tutorials that are easy to follow and understand.

Each step consists of a `title`, `description`, and an optional `image` that is saved on a `How-to Step` entity that is linked to the block entity. The introduction is also stored in a `How-to Step` entity.

The block also stores its state locally in `title` and `description` properties.
