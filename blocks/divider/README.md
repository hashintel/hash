The Divider block is a customizable wrapper around an `<hr>` element.

## Programmatic Usage

The divider can be customized with the following properties ([view the Divider Block entity type](https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/types/entity-type/divider-block/v/2) to see these in context):

- [`Height In Pixels`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/height-in-pixels/)
- [`CSS Background Color`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/css-background-color/)

Its width is set to 100% and its border to "none", allowing the `Height In Pixels` property to control the line's thickness. The `CSS Background Color` property sets the element's background color.

By default, the line will be 1px thick and black.
