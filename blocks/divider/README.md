The Divider block is an `<hr>` element which can be customized with [`https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/height-in-pixels/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/height-in-pixels/) and [`https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/css-background-color/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/css-background-color/) properties.

Its width is set to 100% and its border to "none", allowing the [`https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/height-in-pixels/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/height-in-pixels/) property to control the line's thickness. The [`https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/css-background-color/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/css-background-color/) property sets the element's background color.

By default, the line will be 1px thick and black.
