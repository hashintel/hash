The Countdown block displays the number of days, months, and years until a particular target date. The date is selected with an intuitive date picker and a title can be added above the countdown to provide additional context. Optionally, the number of minutes and hours can also be shown.

The block accepts [`https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/types/property-type/target-date-and-time/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/types/property-type/target-date-and-time/) \[string] in ISO 8601 **date and time** format and uses the Graph Module's `updateEntity` method to store this in the embedding application's storage. [`https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/title/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/title/) \[string] and [`https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/types/property-type/countdown-block-should-display-time/`](https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/types/property-type/countdown-block-should-display-time/) \[boolean] properties set the title and hours and minutes options respectively.
