description: An introduction to your graph

# Overview

Every account in [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) has its own _graph_. An account's graph acts as the canonical reference, or "single-source of truth" for an account's users.

Graphs contain **entities** conforming to a **HASH schema** which defines their **properties**.

Users can create or update entities in their graph directly through the HASH user interface, or by connecting external applications or sources via the **integrations** menu.

Entities in graphs can be easily accessed via the HASH API, and instantiated directly in simulations without data processing.

**HASH is currently only available to self-host (and consequently so are graphs). Hosted HASH graphs are coming soon.**
