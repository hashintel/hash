# Building Process Models

Business processes are the cornerstone of every company's operations. Defined and repeatable plans for satisfying business objectives differentiate a focused, efficient machine from a disorganized mess. However, given the complexity and scale of modern businesses, it can be hard to create and optimize business processes - even simple processes are often hard to reason about or effectively optimize.

Simulation aided process design can dramatically improve results and get you answers fast.

The process chart visual interface makes it incredibly easy to create a powerful process model, no coding expertise required.
