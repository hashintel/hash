Robustness is a measure of a model's ability to produce accurate results when encountering novel data. Most ML and AI models are initially trained on a set of data that is a representative sample of the data it will encounter in production. However, it’s near impossible for training data to fully represent the full complexity of a real world distribution of data - robust models can generalize from specific training data to more general datasets, and handle [data drifts](https://hash.ai/glossary/data-drift) and adversarial inputs gracefully.

A common critique of modern machine learning is its tendency to produce **fragile** models that only work as expected when it encounters data very similar to the type of data it trained on. These models are often said to be **overfit**. While these types of models look good in testing, in production they often fail in unexpected ways.

There are a number of approaches that are being developed for improving robustness:

1.  Better interpretability and understanding of black box AI techniques can, in general, help modelers improve robustness. [Agent-based models](https://hash.ai/glossary/agent-based-modeling) are traditionally more robust than other methods because the agents have set, interpretable behaviors, which allows them to be quickly improved and corrected.
1.  Domain randomization within [multi-agent systems] and [synthetic environments](https://hash.ai/glossary/single-synthetic-environment) can help create in models which perform better under a wider array of conditions, including those which may occur in the real-world but not have been present in historical data used to train models in the first place.
