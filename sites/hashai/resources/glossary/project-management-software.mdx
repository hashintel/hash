Project management software allows people to manage complex projects which span time, personnel, teams, and disciplines. Managers and employees typically break projects into smaller manageable tasks, then track their completion progress. Tasks can capture information such as due dates, assigned employees, resources needed, time estimates, relevant information, and link to other tasks which they are dependent on or block.

Tasks are tracked in a shared visual interface which provides transparency and accountability for all employees, and enables individual ownership. Project management software can also provide quantitative aids for the planning process. As users create data by generating and completing tasks, estimates can be generated for timelines and resources needed to complete a project.
