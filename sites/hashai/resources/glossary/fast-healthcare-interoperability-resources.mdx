The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/" target="_blank">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard</a> (FHIR) is a specification for electronic healthcare data created in 2012. Making healthcare data standardized and discoverable has been a longstanding goal of the industry, to facilitate accurate records being shared between different providers and improve [modeling]. The FHIR was created by created by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_Seven_International" target="_blank">Health Level Seven International</a> (HL7) organization to promote semantic markup of records that work with JSON, XML, or RDF. The FHIR's conceptual primitive is the '<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html" target="_blank">resource</a>':

> A resource is an entity that:
>
> - has a known identity (a URL) by which it can be addressed
> - identifies itself as one of the types of resource defined in this specification
> - contains a set of structured data items as described by the definition of the resource type
> - has an identified version that changes if the contents of the resource change

The focus on resources helps promote an API centric design. The FHIR has been adopted by numerous actors in the healthcare space.
