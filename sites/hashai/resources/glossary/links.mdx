## Links between entities

Links between entities reflect a relationship or other type of connection between them.

For example, a `Person` entity may be considered linked to a `Political Party` entity if they have donated to them, or stood for an election on their behalf.

Entities may have one or more links to entities of any number of types. For example, a `Person` may be linked to more than one `Political Party`. They may also be linked to more than just a `Political Party`. They may have a `Sports Team`, links to many other `Person` entities, and a day job linking them to an employer `Company` entity as well.

## Link types

Links have [types](https://hash.ai/glossary/types). Not all links imply the same thing. We infer meaning through links from their types. A link may indicate current membership, or former membership. It may indicate a positive relationship or a negative one.

## Directed links

Links may be directed or undirected. Directed links imply that a relationship between two entities is not 'equal' -- for example, two entities may have a `Mother` `<>` `Child` relationship. In this case one entity is the literal parent of another, and it is impossible for the reverse to be true. Similarly, two entities `Boss` and `Employee` may be connected by a directional link that conveys the power dynamic governing their relationship.

Undirected links may either be _bidirectional_ (equally mirrored) or their nature may not yet be known.
