A parameter is a constant value that controls or specifies part of the behavior of a system. Parameters can represent values that localize a generic simulation to a specific environment or application, for instance: average rainfall in an agriculture simulation. They can also represent decision variables, for instance the tax rate in an economic policy simulation.

In HASH simulations, agent-level properties are one example of parameters. Simulation-level parameters can be defined by users in the [globals file](https://hash.ai/docs/simulation/creating-simulations/configuration), providing easy access to all agents. HASH experiments function by running simulations with modified sets of those parameters. HASH also provides the means for visual interfaces to be created that vary simulation parameters.
