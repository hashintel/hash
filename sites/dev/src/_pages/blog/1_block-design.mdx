This guide is for developers who want to build blocks with the [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org). The protocol allows you build reusable blocks that will work in any application that also follows the protocol. It acts as the communication layer between an application and a block. The block and the application don't need to know anything about how the other is built. They only need to follow the protocol to work seamlessly together.

This opens up a world of possibilities; as a developer you can build any block you can dream up, publish it to the [Block Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and allow other developers to download and use it in any protocol-compliant application.

This also raises some new challenges though. For your blocks to be successful, loved, and widely used, they need to look and feel great across a wide variety of contexts. **Which means you have to design them well.**

This doesn't mean add fancy gradients and drop shadows to everything. It means following these two principles:

1.  Blocks should be visually simple, minimal, and blend in with their surroundings
2.  Blocks should follow tried-and-true interaction design principles

The first principle helps blocks feel at home in the applications that use them. Each application will have its own visual style and set of design conventions they follow; a design system they've worked hard to establish and keep consistent across their product.

We've designed the protocol with this in mind; we allow applications to pass styling variables into blocks such as `primaryColour` and `fontFamily` (more on this below) which helps them match the visual styling of their environments.

There's more to design than visual appearance though. Blocks need to behave predictably and consistently for the people using them. This means being both internally consistent, and consistent with the way most other websites on the web work. This principle is known as [Jakob's Law](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/) - users spend 99% of their time on apps and websites other than yours, and they expect them to all work the same way. There is no need to reinvent the wheel or the dropdown menu.

There is a much higher risk of inconsistent behaviour when every block in an application is designed and built by someone different, without any shared conventions or rules. We've all felt the frustration of trying to use an app that has 99 button colours, icons that change meaning across screens, and labels that sporadically switch between “cancel,” “discard”, and “delete.” These small frustrations add up and will quickly deplete a user's patience.

Thankfully, you can avoid most of these usability problems by following our visual styling principles and best practices when you're creating blocks.

## Styling Block Protocol blocks

We designed the protocol to give embedding applications control over the way blocks appear in their product. We give embedding applications the final say over how a block looks, as they have more context about the environment it lives within and how people will use it.

Every Block Protocol block must accept a `styleVariables` object that the embedding application can pass in.

This object defines a number of variables that control the basic styles of the block. We've designed these to maximise consistency and simplicity within your block.

### Style Variables

##### Colours

- Primary, secondary, and tertiary colours
- Primary and secondary background colours
- Border colour
- Font colour

##### Spacing

- Base size
- Spacing scale

##### Typography

- Font family
- Base font size
- Typographic scale

##### Borders

- Box border radius
- Button border radius
- Border weight

##### General

- Icon size
- Box shadows

These styling variables can do a lot of the heavy lifting to help blocks match their surrounding environment.

As a block developer, you should make sure the markup in your blocks uses these styling variables to make life easier for the people using your blocks.

Embedding applications can also pass raw CSS into the block if they need to manually override specific styles and layouts. This should be a last resort though, as futzing with CSS selectors can get messy and may end up affecting the core functionality of the block.

## Usability and UX principles

No matter how beautiful a block looks, it's not worth much to anyone if it's difficult to use. Soft drop shadows and smooth gradients aren't going to delight the user if they're furiously trying to find the “save” button, and you've stashed it inside a dropdown menu that's too low contrast to see.

Usability and user experience design (UX) is a whole discipline in its own right, and we can't cover everything in this guide. We're not expecting you to become a UX designer before you can start building blocks. However, knowing the basics of UX and some of the most important principles will go a long way in making you a better block builder. So here's the 80/20 version.

#### 1. Generous touch targets

Touch targets are any area of the screen users will need to click - buttons, icons that trigger actions, or links.

Humans have fat little fingers and we're bad at accurately poking them at screens. On mobile devices, you should make sure any clickable elements are at least 44px wide and high. We're slightly better at hitting targets in the middle of the screen than on the edges. If your touch target is on the edge or corner, bump it up to 50px.

This doesn't mean the icons and text on buttons need to be that large – only the clickable space around it.

We're slightly better at maneouvering a cursor onto a target on desktops, but not by much. Clickable targets should be at least 40px wide and high. You can be sensibly flexible with this; if you have a button that is only 30px high but 200px wide that will do. The general rule is that larger targets = quicker and easier to click.

#### 2. Make editable elements obvious

If the user can edit, manipulate, or input data anywhere in the block, use visual styling to make it clear. This means making buttons look like buttons by giving them a different background colour and clear border.

It means making input fields look like input fields by giving them a border and ideally a subtle inner shadow to indicate they're "fillable".

If you haven't heard, [flat design is bad for usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/). You should instead use _subtle_ indicators of depth like drop shadows, inner shadows, and layering to help users understand how interface elements are related and what they can interact with.

#### 3. Make your blocks A11y accessible

[A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) accessibility covers a wide range of design practices that help make web interfaces easier to use for everyone. Especially people who might be visually, physically, or cognitively impared while they're using your block.

The a11y project has a great [checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#content) you can work through to make sure your blocks meet the basic requirements.

Two common mistakes are having low colour contrast levels and forgetting to include alt tags on images.

#### 4. Follow conventional icon semantics and use labels

Mysterious icons

Ideally, icons should always have text labels next to them. This prevents users from having to guess what the icon means.

Since we live in a world where we don't have infinite screen screen, it can be tricky to fit labels on everything. You should put labels inside tooltips that appear when a user hovers over the icon. This obviously is a better solution for desktop than mobile, as we can't hover with our fingers (yet... still waiting for Apple to figure that one out).

#### 5. Co-locate data and actions

Whenever the user is able to perform an action on data within the block, try to put the button or element that triggers the action as close to the data as possible.

If a user is filling in a form, put the "submit" button right next to the last field.

If a user is applying a set of filters, put the "apply filters" button right next to the selectors.

You can also use containers and spacing to indicate a button is closely related to an area of input.

#### 6. Direct manipulation

A close cousin of co-location, direct manipulation is when we allow users to directly touch and move elements on the screen to change their state. As humans with bodies, we are very used to touching and moving physical objects to manipulate them. Whenever we want to change a digital object we have the same instinct – we try to touch it (or at least, the visual represtation of it on our screens)

## Working with designers

At this point, some of you might be overwhelmed by the number of things you need to consider when designing blocks. Design is hard! There's a reason it's an entire specialised profession that takes decades to master.

If you're working on a block and you want it to be _really_ great, you should find a designer to come work on it with you.
