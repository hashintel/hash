    The computer only knows you've added a bunch of &lt;p&gt; tags to a page, but
    doesn't understand the contents or shape of what you've written inside (at
    least without any fancy natural language processing).

    Unlike plain HTML, blocks created with the [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org) have types, such as Person, Company, and Date that help computers understand what they actually contain.

    Imagine you are creating a webpage to announce a book signing event with a well-known author. You could add an Author block, a Location block, and a Time block to this page. Instead of being some mystery HTML, your information is now readable by computers. It would be much easier to automatically pass this information to other websites and applications, such as a calendar application, or the author's personal website.

    We are trying to fulfil the vision of the Semantic Web (aka. the OG Web3, before all the NFTs took over!), transforming the web's randomly formatted, human-readable pages into structured troves of connected knowledge, improving both user and developer experiences as we go.

    ## Structured data and defining schemas

    Blocks are the basic units we use to build pages on the modern web. They are rectangular sections that contain a set of features and functions. They are sometimes also called components or widgets.

    Each block has a type that determines the [kind of data](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/block-types#data-provided-to-blocks) it can display and edit. You're probably familiar with the most common block types such as paragraph, header, image, list, and table. Some block types have more advanced interactive features such as filtering, search, and sorting.

    There are an infinite number of possible block types. One goal of the Block Protocol is to encourage developers to build and share brand new types of blocks that haven't been seen before, and for applications to offer users far more blocks than any one team could imagine or build.

    ![Example Image](blog/0_test/example.png)

    Blocks can be added to webpages using plain HTML and/or JavaScript. Some modern content management systems (eg. Wordpress, Squarespace) and applications (eg. Notion, Coda) allow you to add blocks to a page using a visual interface. With these block-based editors you can usually rearrange the order of blocks on a page using drag and drop. Blocks can be stacked on top of one another, arranged in columns, or embedded inside other blocks.
