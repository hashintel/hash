# About this directory

This `sites` directory contains the source-code and/or content for a number of HASH's public-facing websites, including:

- [hash.ai](https://hash.ai/): our main website
- [hash.dev](https://hash.dev/): our developer-focused website

The source code for the Block Protocol website can be found in the `site` subdirectory of the [blockprotocol/blockprotocol repo](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/site) on GitHub.

Our [hash.community](https://hash.community/) Discourse forum source can be found in our private [hashintel/internal monorepo](https://github.com/hashintel/internal), but should be added here in due course.
