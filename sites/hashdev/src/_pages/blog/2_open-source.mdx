We release a large amount of our code at HASH under either an open-source or fair-source license. In both cases the respective parts of our codebase are public, but there are slightly different terms attached to what you can and can't do with the underlying source code.

Broadly there are three categories of licenses we publish code publicly under at HASH:
1. Open-source and permissive — e.g. MIT/Apache - in essence these licenses give people the freedom to do pretty much whatever they like, including extend the code and keep it private (making this the most flexible category of license)
2. Open-source and copyleft — e.g. AGPL - again gives people freedom to use the code however they like, provided if they extend or modify it they contribute those changes back into the open-source as well under the same terms
3. Fair-source — e.g. SSPL/Elastic - gives people access to and freedom to use code directly, and the ability to self-host the product without reliance on us (its creator). More on these licenses at https://faircode.io/

Since our founding, we’ve been extremely deliberate about how we’ve licensed the various parts of our platform, as well as what we ourselves use in HASH.

First, we contribute original open-source software (OSS) into the ecosystem through our [HASH platform](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) (AGPL), its connectors (MIT/Apache), and our blocks (MIT/Apache). You can [find these](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/packages/hash) on GitHub.

Second, we leverage existing OSS within our platform to accelerate development and provide users with best-in-class experiences. This includes great technologies such as OpenSearch (an Apache fork of two other previously open-source projects, Elasticsearch and Kibana), Snowplow (Apache), Meltano (MIT), dbt (Apache), Great Expectations (Apache), and GitLab (MIT). In addition, we use dozens of other open-source packages within our extended codebase.

Third, we publish a lot of the source code for the non-OSS components of our platform (such as [hEngine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine)) publicly under fair-code licenses like the Elastic License/SSPL. This allows any HASH user to utilize our simulation technology freely within their organizations for internal-use, free from restriction, provided they don’t offer this technology to others as a managed service themselves (as that would be competitive with our core business). The Elastic License, for example, imposes just three high-level restrictions on the use of software. First, it is forbidden to provide the product to others as a managed service. Second, it is forbidden to circumvent any license key functionality, or remove/obscure feature protected by those keys. And third, removing or obscuring license, copyright and other legal notices is not allowed.

Finally, we regularly evaluate the competitive landscape to see if we can (a) move private code into public repositories either as fair-code or open-source, and (b) relicense fair-code as open-source. When the environment changes, so do we. In keeping with our mission to continuously reduce and eliminate information failures, our ultimate goal is to have a fully sustainable business with as large an open-source footprint as possible. We can’t even come close to conceiving all the ways our technology might eventually be used by innovative others and it’s important to us to provide future innovators with as much freedom and flexibility as possible — but without compromising our own ability to pursue HASH’s mission over the sustainable long-term.

Our open-source strategy stands in contrast to the approach of others within the structured-knowledge and simulation space, such as Wolfram, who argue that open-sourcing their software would reduce its quality (see: "Why Wolfram Tech Isn’t Open Source—A Dozen Reasons"). We passionately but respectfully believe the opposite to be true. In fact, many of Wolfram's criticisms of open-source are straw-men or outright falsifiable.

- "A coherent vision requires centralized design" (1) disregards that many OSS projects have benevelolent dictators who impose design standards, constraints and their ideas upon the evolution of a project akin to how any company management might. "High-level languages need more design than low-level languages" (2) which follows is therefore not an argument against OSS either. "Crowd-sourced decisions can be bad for you" (5) and "Unified computation" and "Unified representation" requiring "unified design" (7 & 8) can be dismissed similarly, as can "Bad design is expensive" (12).
- "You need multidisciplinary teams to unify disparate fields" (3) turns a blind eye to the diversity of many OSS projects, including HASH whose contributors come from multiple continents, have varied backgrounds, and in fact represent a much wider set of life-experiences and disciplines than a single company alone might hope to capture within its organizational structure.
- "Hard cases and boring stuff need to get done too" (4) ignores the possibility of commercial entities advancing OSS projects. "Our developers work for you, not just themselves" (6) is true only under the same misconception.
- "Open-source doesn’t bring major tech innovation to market" (9) can be disproven by a thousand major projects, and the entirety of the modern internet.
- Meanwhile "Paid software offers an open quid pro quo" (10) mischaracterizes and ignores various open-source business models that allow OSS to be both free at the point of access, and profitable businesses (e.g. through the provision of paid support, as Red Hat pioneered prior to their sale to IBM for _$34 billion_ USD).
- "It takes steady income to sustain long-term R&D" (11) is obviously true. And again many OSS projects are able to be profitable and command a stable income. However since the advent of debt in approximately 3500 BC it's been possible to operate without this -- in promise or expectation of future cash-flows -- and modern financing in the form of venture capital provides additional routes to market.

The likes of Wolfram find themselves constrained by path-dependency and struggling to justify historical choices and outdated business models. Changing now would risk cannibalizing their existing paying user-base, disrupting short-medium term cash flows. We are unencumbered by such mistakes and unconstrained by a lack of such concerns.

Good design requires effective decision-making at the top, and is at the heart of everything we do at HASH, but it benefits from a wide-range of inputs and eyeballs. Open-source is a fundamentally better approach to robust, reliable, effective software development.
