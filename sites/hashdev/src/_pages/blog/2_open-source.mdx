## Working in public

At HASH, we publish as much of our code as possible in public.

Depending on the code in question, it's typically released under one of three types of license, each of which has slightly different terms attached to what you can and can't do with the underlying source code:

1. **Open-source and permissive licensing:** in essence these licenses give people the freedom to do pretty much whatever they like, including extend the code and keep it private (making this the most flexible category of license). The entirety of the [Block Protocol](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol) is available under these terms (by way of the _MIT License_).
1. **Open-source and copyleft licensing:** again gives people freedom to use the code however they like, provided if they extend or modify it they contribute those changes back into the open-source as well under the same terms. Our [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) application is available under the _AGPL_.
1. **Fair-source licensing:** gives people access to and freedom to use code directly, and the ability to self-host the product without reliance on us (its creator). However it limits the ability of others to create competing commercial offerings based on the fair-source code. [HASH Engine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine) is released under the _Elastic License (ELv2)_ which allows anyone to use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works. However it restricts folks from using the software to provide a managed service to others.

## How we think about open-source

First, **we contribute** original open-source software (OSS) into the ecosystem through our [HASH platform](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) (AGPL), its connectors (MIT/Apache), and our blocks (MIT/Apache). You can [find these](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/packages/hash) on GitHub.

Second, **we leverage** existing OSS within our platform to accelerate development and provide users with best-in-class experiences. This includes great technologies such as OpenSearch (an Apache fork of two other previously open-source projects, Elasticsearch and Kibana), Snowplow (Apache), Meltano (MIT), dbt (Apache), Great Expectations (Apache), and GitLab (MIT). In addition, we use dozens of other open-source packages within our extended codebase.

Third, **we publish** a lot of the source code for the non-OSS components within our platform (such as [hEngine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine)) publicly under fair-code licenses like the Elastic License. This allows any HASH user to utilize our simulation technology freely within their organizations for internal-use, free from restriction, provided they don’t offer this technology to others as a managed service themselves (as that would be competitive with our core business). The Elastic License, for example, imposes just three high-level restrictions on the use of software. First, it is forbidden to provide the product to others as a managed service. Second, it is forbidden to circumvent any license key functionality, or remove/obscure feature protected by those keys. And third, removing or obscuring license, copyright and other legal notices is not allowed.

Finally, **we regularly evaluate the competitive landscape** to see if we can (a) move private code into public repositories either as fair-code or open-source, and (b) relicense fair-code as open-source. When the environment changes, so do we. In keeping with our mission to continuously reduce and eliminate information failures, our ultimate goal is to have a fully sustainable business with as large an open-source footprint as possible. We can’t even come close to conceiving all the ways our technology might eventually be used by innovative others and it’s important to us to provide future innovators with as much freedom and flexibility as possible — but without compromising our own ability to pursue HASH’s mission over the sustainable long-term.

Our open-source strategy stands in contrast to the approach of others within the structured-knowledge and simulation space, such as Wolfram, who argue that open-sourcing their software would reduce its quality (see: <a href="https://blog.wolfram.com/2019/04/02/why-wolfram-tech-isnt-open-source-a-dozen-reasons/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Why Wolfram Tech Isn’t Open Source—A Dozen Reasons</a>). We passionately but respectfully believe the opposite to be true.

## What Wolfram gets wrong

Many of Wolfram's stated criticisms of open-source are straw-men or outright falsifiable.

1. **Strong leadership and design can still be provided within open-source.** Wolfram's first "argument" against open-source is that "a coherent vision requires centralized design" (1). This claim disregards the very many OSS projects with benevelolent dictators who impose design standards, constraints and their own ideas upon the evolution of their projects, much akin to how any company management might. Their second claim, in defense of Wolfram being closed-source, is that "high-level languages need more design than low-level languages" (2) which it also follows is therefore not an argument against OSS either. "Crowd-sourced decisions can be bad for you" (5) and "Unified computation" and "Unified representation" requiring "unified design" (7 & 8) can be dismissed similarly, as can "Bad design is expensive" (12). _None of these are arguments against open-source so much as they are arguments for strong leadership, which remains eminently possible._
1. **Open-source communities are more diverse, not less.** Wolfram argue that "you need multidisciplinary teams to unify disparate fields" (3), a statement that is undoubtedly true. Yet claiming this as an argument _against_ open-source turns a blind eye to the diversity and breadth of expertise found within many OSS projects, including HASH, whose contributors come from multiple continents, have varied backgrounds, and in fact represent a much wider set of life-experiences and disciplines than a single company alone might hope to capture within its organizational structure.
1. **Commercial entities can be open-source.** Wolfram argue that "hard cases and boring stuff need to get done too" (4), essentially implying that open-source maintainers and coders can't be trusted to knuckle down and focus on important maintainability, or boring peripheral work that make technologies meaningful and impactful. Not only is this patronizing to the thousands of open-source developers who care passionately about the products they build, but it ignores the possibility of commercial entities advancing OSS projects and acting with similar motivations to any other private company. "Our developers work for you, not just themselves" (6) operates under the same misconception. Meanwhile "Paid software offers an open quid pro quo" (10) mischaracterizes and ignores the various business models that allow OSS to be both free at the point of access, and profitable (e.g. through the provision of paid complements, such as the famous support services provided by _Red Hat_ which justified their $34 billion sale to _IBM_ in 2019).
1. **Huge technological advances occur in the open.** Wolfram's claim "Open-source doesn’t bring major tech innovation to market" (9) can be disproven by a thousand major projects, and the entirety of the modern internet. We won't list the many projects here that prove the statement's desperate vacuity.
1. **There are many long-term financing options and sustainable business models available to open-source projects.** According to Wolfram, "it takes steady income to sustain long-term R&D" (11) -- the first obvious truth in their piece. However many OSS projects are able to both command a stable income, and be profitable. Since the advent of debt in approximately 3500 BC it's been possible to operate without monetizing upfront -- in promise or expectation of future cash-flows -- and modern financing in the form of venture capital is practically predicated on this. To ignore the last five millenia of human experience seems unwise.

The likes of Wolfram find themselves constrained by path-dependency and struggling to justify historical choices and a conseqeuntly outdated business model. Changing now would risk cannibalizing their existing paying user-base, disrupting short-to-medium term cash flows. We are relatively unencumbered.

Good design requires effective decision-making at the top, and is at the heart of everything we do at HASH. But it also benefits from a wide-range of inputs and eyeballs. Open-source is a fundamentally better approach to robust, reliable, effective software development.
