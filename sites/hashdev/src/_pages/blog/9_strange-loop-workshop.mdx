## Strange Loop 2022

Strange Loop is a developer conference with a heavy focus on _actually developing software_. That means no sponspored keynotes, no selling of attendee lists to sponsors, and no product marketing dressed up as talks.

We'll be running a workshop on day one of the conference, this coming Thursday, that provides a practical introduction to building blocks atop v0.2 of the Block Protocol.

## The Block Protocol

The Block Protocol standardizes the interface between web applications and individual content blocks (e.g. a table, chart, or video). Its goal is to enable any block to be usable by any web application without any configuration or human intervention, once both are compliant with the Protocol.

Blocks can be built using any web technology or library (e.g. Web Components, React).

Workshop attendees require basic skills in frontend development, and will be guided step-by-step through building and publishing a block which can then be immediately accessed and used within any Block Protocol supporting application.

## Register to attend

I'll be leading the workshop alongside HASH co-founder Jude Allred. Anybody can register on the [Strange Loop website](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/). The organizers are selling tickets for as little as $50, but if you can't make it live, in follow-up we'll be publishing the tutorial developed for the workshop as a standalone guide that you can consume at your own pace, and from the comfort of your own home (or workplace!)

### About _HASH_ and the _Block Protocol_

_HASH_ is building the next generation of decision-making, data modeling, and knowledge management tools. HASH combines a [global entity graph](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) with [composable blocks](https://blockprotocol.org/) for semantic interface-building, alongside rich data-processing and [simulation](https://hash.ai/simulations) capabilities to enable everybody to make the right decisions. The _Block Protocol_ is the open framework and standard for block-app communication. It standardizes not just how blocks may be inserted within embedding applications, but how they and their embedders can communicate with one another and operate on semantically rich data structures, providing native-like experiences to users while leveraging an unbounded ecosystem of externally developed blocks and types.
