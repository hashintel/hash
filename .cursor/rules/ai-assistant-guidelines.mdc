# Guidelines for AI Assistants

This file contains standards for how AI assistants should interact with codebases and follow project guidelines.

## Core Principles

1. **Autonomy**: Take responsibility for following all project rules without requiring reminders.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase and established patterns.
3. **Proactivity**: Anticipate rule requirements before starting work on any task.
4. **Accuracy**: Ensure adherence to all relevant guidelines in every implementation.

## Things to avoid

1. Making changes unrelated to the task at hand - if you see other things in a file that could be improved, suggest them to the user!
2. Getting stuck for a long time without asking for help - if you're struggling, just ask.

## Self-Checking Process

When working on any project task:

1. **Discovery**:
   - Identify all relevant rule files for the current context
   - Scan directories like `.cursor/rules/` for applicable guidelines
   - Look for language-specific, style, and organizational conventions

2. **Preparation**:
   - Review all applicable guidelines before beginning work
   - Identify patterns in existing code that demonstrate rule application
   - Prioritize project-specific conventions over generic best practices

3. **Validation**:
   - Before submitting any changes, verify compliance with ALL project guidelines
   - Ensure consistency with surrounding code
   - Detect and correct any rule violations proactively

## Effective Rule Application

For any development task:

1. **Context Assessment**:
   - Determine which rules apply to the current task
   - Consider the specific file type, language, and component

2. **Implementation Guidance**:
   - Apply relevant rules throughout the implementation process
   - Use existing code patterns as guidance for ambiguous cases
   - Maintain the established style and conventions

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Verify rule compliance before finalizing work
   - Ensure consistency across similar components
   - Validate that all project-specific requirements are met

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Requiring reminders about existing project guidelines
- Implementing solutions that contradict established patterns
- Applying inconsistent approaches across similar tasks
- Overlooking project-specific conventions in favor of generic practices
- Introducing deviations from standards without explicit justification

AI assistants should consistently enforce project guidelines without being prompted. Your role includes ensuring that all contributions adhere to the established rules of the project.
