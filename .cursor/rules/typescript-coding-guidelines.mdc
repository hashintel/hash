# General

- Prefer 'const myFunc = () => {}' over function declarations.
- Parallelize async calls where appropriate via `Promise.all` instead of sequential fetches in a `for` loop.
- No `any` allowed. If the input type is genuinely unknown, use `unknown` and write appropriate logic to narrow the type.
- Don't make formatting corrections to lines you aren't already modifying. Auto-fixing will handle it.

# Frontend

- Use React function components
- Use MUI components for all HTML elements (import from `@mui/material`)
  - Style using the `sx` prop
  - Flex boxes should use the `Stack` component
