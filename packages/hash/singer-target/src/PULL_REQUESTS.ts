      body: "This is a new example that will turn into a few things, I think.\r\nInitially, it's a way for me to test a large amount of data. The README\r\nshows the data sizes being tested. It served as a way for me to feel\r\nconfident in its behavior with a large, organic dataset.\r\n\r\nTo adequately do that, more than just counting the records needs to\r\nhappen. Two uses come to mind:\r\n\r\n- Benchmarks for querying various aspects of the dataset, with other\r\n  implementations for other database.\r\n- Creating a command-line interface that can be used to browse/search\r\n  the database. The way this is written could serve as a good larger\r\n  example.\r\n\r\nOf note, running this multiple times causes the ratings set to be\r\nappended to each time. This is because the dataset doesn't have a\r\nprimary key for each row, most likely due to it being anonymized.",
