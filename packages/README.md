# Packages

This directory's contents are in the process of being integrated into the `apps`, `libs` and `tests` folders in the project root. The `packages` folder will shortly cease to exist.

## `hash`

Our [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform/hash) codebase can be found in `hash`. HASH is a data-driven, schema-centric, all-in-one workspace built atop the [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org/).

## `libs`

`libs` contains the source code for the `deer` and `error-stack` Rust crates which will be moved to the root `libs` directory shortly.
