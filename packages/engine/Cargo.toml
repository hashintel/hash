# The nng compilation functionality of nng-sys doesn't compile on Arch-based Mac's so it's necessary to
# disable default-features on nng (which calls nng-sys's build step). We currently have to build on arm Macs by
# targetting x86, so we can't use a cfg conditional to check for arm as the target. So, Intel Mac users will
# just have to manually enable the build-nng feature flag. Or they will have to set an NNG_PATH (see README).
