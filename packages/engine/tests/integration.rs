//! The hEngine integration test suite runs a variety of specially-designed simulations and
//! experiments of specific functionalities to verify outputs.

mod units;

/// Opens `$project` relative to the caller's file as a HASH simulation project and expects
/// `$project/integration-test.json` to exist and be configuration for the test.
///
/// The configuration contains a list of objects, where each object has the following values:
/// - for a simple experiment:
///   - "experiment": Name of the experiment to run as specified in `experiments.json`
///   - "expected-outputs": List of expected outputs, where the length of the list must be equal to
///     the number of simulations of the experiment. Each entry of the list is an object with the
///     step number as its key mapped to the expected outputs of the corresponding step in the
///     simulation run as its value:
///     - "json-state": set of values required to exist and match for the given step in the
///       simulation output
///     - "globals": set of values required to exist and match the `globals.json` output
///     - "analysis-outputs": set of values required to exist and match the `analysis_outputs.json`
///       output
/// - for single-run experiments:
///   - "steps": Number of steps to run
///   - "expected-output": Expected output of the simulation containing with the same schema as one
///     element in "expected-outputs"
