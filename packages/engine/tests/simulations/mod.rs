///   - "experiment": Name of the experiment to run as specified in `experiments.json`
///   - "expected-outputs": List of expected outputs, where the length of the list must be equal to
///     the number of simulations of the experiment. Each entry of the list is an object with the

///     - "json-state": set of values required to exist and match for the given step in the
///       simulation output
///     - "globals": set of values required to exist and match the `globals.json` output
///     - "analysis-outputs": set of values required to exist and match the `analysis_outputs.json`
///       output
/// - for single-run experiments:
///   - "steps": Number of steps to run
///   - "expected-output": Expected output of the simulation containing with the same schema as one
///     element in "expected-outputs"
