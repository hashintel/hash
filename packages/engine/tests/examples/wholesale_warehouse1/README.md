This simulations models a wholesale warehouse with multiple zones and workers. Pallets arrive by trucks and are unloaded to the Reception zone where they are handled, registered, and then moved to Storage to await an order request. Once an order is received, a pallet is removed from storage and transported to the Dispatch zone. Workers then move the pallet orders to trucks where they are moved and delivered out of the warehouse.

Workers/Forklift numbers for each type can be adjusted in `globals.json`. Arrival time for pallets and orders can also be adjusted in `globals.json`.

Two layout maps are provided. One with a max of 6 available forklifts and one with a max of 9 available forklifts.
