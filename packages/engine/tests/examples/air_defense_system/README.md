The Air Defense Simulation model simulates three radars protecting a number of assets from bomber aircrafts.

Each radar has a certain number of available missiles and a coverage zone. If an aircraft enters one of these zones, the corresponding radar targets the craft and shoots a missile. Once hit, the aircraft falls from the sky and the radar restocks its missile supply. However, if an aircraft manages to slip by unseen or a missile misses, the aircraft heads to its target asset and releases a bomb before continuing on with its flight. Assets hit with a bomb burn for a certain amount of time before becoming destroyed and have a small chance of regenerating each time step.
