A model of ants foraging for food. This is a classic agent-based modeling example that shows intelligent system behavior emerging from simple individual behavior.

Ants will begin from the nest (yellow tower) and randomly search for food, represented by the green squares. When they find food they travel back to the nest and deposit "pheromone" behind them. These ants are colored red until they deposit the food.

If searching ants detect pheromone in the area in front of them they will orient towards the strongest "scent". These ants are colored blue as long as they continue following pheromones.
