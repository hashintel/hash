Call centers within the environment are agents interconnected with each other. When calls are made to each center they are routed to an operator. If no operator is available, they are added to a queue and if the queue is full, the call center attempts to route the call to another center through links. If another center is able to take the call and there is a link present (with a capacity greater than 0), the call is transferred. Otherwise, the call is discarded, or balked.
