// The Metaversion of a Shared Batch.
//
// The Metaversion of a Batch is used by language runners and the datastore to keep
// track of when memory or batch reload is required. 
//
// For example, when the current metaversion for a batch the Python runner is {2, 3},
// and a task command comes in with the Metaversion of {2, 4} then as 3 != 4
// the RecordBatch component of the Shared Batch has to be reloaded.
//
// It is the job of every language runner to be responsible for updating 
// (and distributing) the metaversion whenever it makes a change to the shared batch 
// which has consequences for other runners (or the datastore for that matter).
//
// NB! Whenever a memory reload is required, then the recordbatch has to be reloaded
// too.
//
// fields:
//    `memory`: shared memory segment metaversion
//    `batch` : RecordBatch metaversion
