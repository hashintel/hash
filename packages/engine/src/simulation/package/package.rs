Generics for packages

Note that generalization cannot be done for all package traits.
See [#20400](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20400) for why Init, Context,
State and Output package (and other respective) traits cannot be (sensibly) generalized
into one even though they are clearly disjoint.
