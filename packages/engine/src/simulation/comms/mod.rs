# System

This module provides the tools for packages to communicate with the language runtimes.

### What can be sent to the language runtimes

Calls to language runtimes are of two main types:
1) Distributed
    - These calls mean that batches of agents are worked on
    in multiple workers
2) Centralized
    - All of State is loaded into a single language worker


Distributed calls can yield significant performance benefits. For distributed calls however,
packages have to define a `DistributedMessageHandler` which must be able to handle
inbound completion messages from multiple workers and combine them into one such that the
main package definition can be agnostic of how work was distributed.
