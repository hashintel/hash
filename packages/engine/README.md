# hEngine
[HASH Engine](https://hash.ai/platform/engine?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) (or **hEngine**) is the computational simulation engine at the heart of [HASH](https://hash.ai/platform?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine). We have not yet published it, but intend to under the terms of the Server-Side Public License (based on GPLv3, and created by MongoDB). The version that will be released here contains several notable differences to the hosted version powering [hCore](https://hash.ai/platform/core?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) and [hCloud](https://hash.ai/platform/cloud?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) which will be documented.

## Issue Tracking
We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hashintel/engine/issues) to help prioritize and track bugs and feature requests for HASH. This includes hEngine, as well as our **hCore** IDE, and the [**HASH.ai site**](https://hash.ai/platform/index?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine). You can also report issues and get support on our public [Discord server](https://hash.ai/discord?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine). Please submit any issues you encounter.

## Documentation
Our [docs](https://docs.hash.ai/?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) contain beginner guides and in-depth tutorials for **hCore** today. These will be extended to cover hEngine upon its public release.

The [HASH wiki](https://hash.ai/wiki?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) contains helpful explainers around key modeling, simulation and AI-related terms and concepts.

## Questions & Support
We're building a community of people who care about enabling better decision-making through modeling and simulation. Our [support forum](https://hash.community/?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) and [HASH community Discord server](https://hash.ai/discord?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=github_readme_engine) (requires login) are both great places to meet other modelers and get help.
