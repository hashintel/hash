//! Structures for representing an `Agent`.
//!
//! For a high-level concept of an agent, please see the [HASH documentation].
//!
//! The main struct in this module is [`Agent`]. It contains all agent fields as an accessible
//! struct. Its fields are represented by [`AgentStateField`], which is based on the [`field`] API.
//! A group of [`Agent`]s has an in-memory representation defined by [`AgentSchema`] and can be used
//! by [`AgentBatch`] or, in case of multiple groups of [`Agent`]s, [`AgentBatchPool`]. To convert
//! an [`AgentBatch`] to [`Vec`]`<`[`Agent`]`>`, the [`IntoAgents`] trait is used.
