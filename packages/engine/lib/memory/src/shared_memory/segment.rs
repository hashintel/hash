//       code outside the datastore can't mutate memory directly, even if it has mutable access to a
//       batch. `CMemory` in the Python FFI would need to be replaced with `CSegment`.

//       into memory and batch versions, because some segments contain things which don't really
//       have batch versions, e.g. datasets.
/// Used by datasets, agent batches, message batches, context global batch, [`PreparedBatch`].
