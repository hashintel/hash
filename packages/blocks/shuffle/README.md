The Shuffle Block allows us to create a list of 'Things' and set them into a random order.

It accepts the property `items` which consists of an array of objects.
If this property is not provided, the list will default to:

```javascript
[
  { id: "1", value: "Thing 1" },
  { id: "2", value: "Thing 2" },
];
```
