//! Definitions of the elements of the Type System stored in the [`store`].

//! This module contains the definitions of [`EntityType`]s, and [`LinkType`]s. The structs are Rust
//! representations of their meta-schemas defined within the Block Protocol specification, and are
//! used to validate instances of types using [`serde`]. To aid with the de/serialization,
//! intermediary structs and helpers are defined across various submodules.
