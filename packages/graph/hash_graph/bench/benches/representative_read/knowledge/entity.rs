/// Benchmark to measure the time taken to query the latest version of an entity by its ID.
///
/// Across runs, Criterion compares benchmarks that share the same ID. We'd like to be able to
/// track performance overtime, so we need to have consistent IDs. This means that if we're
/// auto-generating entity ID's, we can't use them as inputs to `bench_with_input`, as the
/// [`BenchmarkId`] will vary between runs and we won't get comparative analysis.
///
/// We also don't really want to measure how long it takes to query a sample of IDs (e.g. to make
/// 100 entity queries). As such, this function takes a list of [`EntityId`]s to sample from, and
/// uses `iter_batched` to do a per-iteration setup whereby each benchmark iteration picks a
/// random entity to sample. This should provide us with an idea of average performance for
/// _querying a single entity_ across the given sample.
