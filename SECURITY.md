# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Security updates are only published for the latest minor version of each of our packages.** We have no expectation of beginning to publish security patches for older versions of our packages in the near future.

## Enterprise Support

If you are an enterprise customer with specific security requirements you can [contact us via the HASH website](https://hash.ai/contact) or email [security@hash.ai](mailto:security@hash.ai)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the work of security researchers who help keep our users safe. To responsibly and confidentially disclose vulnerabilities in any of our code, email a report to [security@hash.ai](mailto:security@hash.ai) or use the form at [hash.ai/contact](https://hash.ai/contact) - please **do not** open a public thread, _Issue_ or _Discussion_ on this GitHub repository containing any security-related reports as this may put users at risk.
