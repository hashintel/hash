Revamp design token system: Radix-based color generation with semantic bg/fg/bd token structure, expanded 00–120 color scales with OKLCH interpolation, runtime-scalable spacing/radii/line-height via CSS variable factors, and extended conditions. Migrate all consumers to new token naming conventions.
