# deer-macros

`deer` is an **experimental** backend-agnostic deserialization framework for Rust, featuring meaningful error messages and context (utilizing [`error-stack`](https://crates.io/crates/error-stack)) and a fail-slow behavior by default.

`deer-macros` is a collection of derive macros to automatically implement `Deserialize` for types.
