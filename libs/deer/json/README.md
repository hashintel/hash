# deer-json

`deer` is an **experimental** backend-agnostic deserialization framework for Rust, featuring meaningful error messages and context (utilizing [`error-stack`](https://crates.io/crates/error-stack)) and a fail-slow behavior by default.

`deer-json` is an implementation of the `deer` deserializer for the JSON data format.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This crate does not ship with any functionality and is only a name reservation to stop potential name squatting. In the future the actual crate will be published under this name, for the current (incomplete) implementation of the crate please visit the linked repository.
