# Libraries

Contains the source code for software development libraries which HASH has published for general use. Full write-ups of most can be found on the [HASH website for developers], and a summary table is included below for convenience.

## Internal Libraries

Although open-source, the following libraries were developed for internal use and may be subject to breaking changes. External consumers should be especially careful when using or upgrading these.

## Publishing

### Rust

Publishable Rust crates are automatically published on merge to `main` if their version has been modified.

A crate can be marked as _publishable_ by adding it to the list of `PUBLISH_PATTERNS` in [.github/scripts/rust/setup.py](/.github/scripts/rust/setup.py)

The publishing process is tested automatically, and therefore can be verified through, a dry-run within CI on pull requests.

### TypeScript

Publishing of TypeScript libraries is handled via [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

To record a change for publication:

1.  From the root of the repository, run `yarn changeset`
1.  Select the package(s) affected by this change (space to select, enter to move to the next step)

- Do not worry about selecting packages which depend on changed packages â€“ Changesets will handle bumping them

1.  Select the semver increment
1.  Describe the change
1.  Commit the created changeset file

When a PR with a changeset file is merged, the change is added to a PR entitled 'Version Packages',
which has a diff showing the version increments which will be applied to affected packages, including dependents.

Once the 'Version Packages' PR is merged, the changes are published to npm.
