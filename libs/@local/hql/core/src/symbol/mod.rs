//! Symbol handling for HashQL
//!
//! This module defines a dedicated type for representing symbols in HashQL. Symbols are
//! values, such as literals, identifiers, and keywords, that are used throughout the compilation
//! process and are deliberately kept separate from the CST to optimize their lifecycle and memory
//! usage.
//!
//! The `Symbol` type is purposely designed as an opaque wrapper to enable future optimizations
//! such as string interning (either through the `string_interner` crate or a custom implementation)
//! without requiring changes to the API.
//!
//! Unlike in Rust where symbols are in `rustc_span`, we've chosen to separate this module from
//! `hashql-span` to better represent the distinct lifecycle of symbols as long-lived objects that
//! persist across various stages of compilation.
