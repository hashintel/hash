//! HaRPC (HASH RPC) protocol related codec implementations.
//!
//! This module provides encoding and decoding functionality for the HaRPC protocol,
//! which is used for remote procedure calls within the HASH platform. The wire format
//! uses a binary protocol with a fixed-size header followed by a variable-length payload.
//!
//! The module includes:
//! - Wire protocol codec for serializing and deserializing HaRPC messages
//! - Type aliases for working with request and response messages
