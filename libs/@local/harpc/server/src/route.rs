/// Route requests to the appropriate handler based on the request's service and version.
///
/// This is essentially a type-level linked list of handlers, it's boxed equivalent is [`Steer`],
/// but unlike [`Steer`] it doesn't require the same type for all handlers and a separation of both
/// the meta information (service id and version) and the actual handler. Unlike [`Steer`], it also
/// doesn't require `&mut self` access, which allows for more granular cloning.
///
/// # Design motivations
///
/// The reason why we essentially require `Clone`/`Copy` for the handlers is that once the route is
/// constructed it needs to be available for each request that happens, now, there are multiple ways
/// to achieve this.
///
/// One way would be to simply clone the entire [`Router`] during each request, but that has the
/// downside of potentially cloning a lot of data that isn't actually required for each request,
/// making the addition of new handlers slower and slower.
/// The other solution instead would be to `Mutex` the entire [`Router`], but that would make the
/// entire [`Router`] essentially single-threaded, which is not ideal.
///
/// This takes a middle ground, which is similar in implementation to other tower-based frameworks,
/// such as axum. The inner routes are stored in an `Arc<T>`, which is cheap to clone, but means we
/// need to require `&self` during routing. Once a route was chosen, we simply clone the service
/// (and oneshot) the service. This keeps the cloned data minimal and allows for multi-threading.
///
/// The downside is that we're unable to keep any state in a service delegate that's persisted
/// across invocations. To signal this, `ServiceDelegate` takes `self` and consumes it (even though
/// it isn't strictly needed), as well as the use of sessions. To store any information across
/// calls, one must make use of smart pointers, such as `Arc`.
