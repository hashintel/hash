/// Delegates service calls to an inner typed service.

/// The implementation is responsible for encoding and decoding the request and response bodies.
///
/// Implementations of this trait should derive or implement `Clone`, and ensure that cloning
/// is a cheap operation. Every request likely will clone the delegate, meaning any expensive clone
/// operation will be repeated for each request and add latency.

/// [`Self::Service`].
