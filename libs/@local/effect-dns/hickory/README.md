# Effect DNS Hickory Implementation

Currently no additional packages are required, as this package doesn't need to be published, in the future if published, the `yarn regenerate-packages` command needs to be executed. This will create all required packages that are required for publishing. For more information on publishing see <https://napi.rs/docs/cli/artifacts> and <https://napi.rs/docs/introduction/simple-package>.
