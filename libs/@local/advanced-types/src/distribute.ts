/**
 * 'Omit' for use on a union, to 'distribute' the omit across the union, rather than applying it to an intersection of the union
 * â€“ 'Omit' applies to an intersection because it applies keyof to T, which gives an interaction of the keys of union T.
 * We must use a conditional mapped type to apply the Omit to each member of the union instead.
