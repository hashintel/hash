    – the same workflowId/flowRunId is the mechanism by which consecutive runs which continue from/retry a previous can be identified.

    While Temporal allows for re-use of workflowId across arbitrary flows, our business logic does not re-use them, and they are only re-used:
    1. in the 'continue as new' case, in which case we will need to combine the history of those runs to form a complete picture of the flow's execution.
    2. in the retry case, in which case the failed runs are only important if we want to expose past failures to the user.
