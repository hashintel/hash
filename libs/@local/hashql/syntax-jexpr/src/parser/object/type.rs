// TODO: there's a fundamental problem here: how do we propagate that type up to the AST? With just
// `Type` it's going to not be representable as an expression. There needs to be a `TypeDef` and a
// type? No that's not the case, that just means we can only use function application to create
// types that way. Which isn't great per-s√©, but manageable, but then again. It'd be good to have
// the ability to operate on types. But you can do that. The problem is simply the specific parsing
// here and parsing rules for e.g. struct type creation. In that sense a dedicated AST node for
// types would make things easier, but it would also kind of destroy composability. Then again it's
// the most straightforward way to do this. The problem is primarily with placement. We could
// introduce a type node that is then immediately removed upon resolving, although it's always
// easier to add something than remove, especially when trying to adhere to contract.
// The only problem I see is that we're unable to represent `["type", "name", "..."]` right now
// without such a node.
