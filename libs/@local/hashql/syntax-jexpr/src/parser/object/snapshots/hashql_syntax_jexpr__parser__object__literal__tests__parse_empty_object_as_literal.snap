error[parser::object::empty]: Empty object not allowed

  ├ help: J-Expr objects must contain at least one key-value pair with a specific structure. For example: `{"#literal": 42}` or `{"#struct": {"name": {"#literal": "value"}}}`
  ╰ note: J-Expr requires objects to have a specific structure represented by one of these constructs:
          - `{"#struct": {...}, "#type"?: ...}` - For structured data with named fields
          - `{"#dict": {...}, "#type"?: ...}` - For dictionary/map-like data
          - `{"#tuple": [...], "#type"?: ...}` - For fixed-size ordered collections
          - `{"#list": [...], "#type"?: ...}` - For variable-length ordered collections
          - `{"#literal": value}` - For simple scalar values
          - `{"#type": "typename"}` - For type declarations
          
          Empty objects don't have semantic meaning in J-Expr.
