   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Help: The `#type` field must be used alongside a primary construct like `#struct`, `#list`, etc. It cannot be used alone in an object.
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: The `#type` field is used to annotate the type of a construct. Valid examples include:
   â”‚           - `{"#struct": {...}, "#type": "Person"}`
   â”‚           - `{"#list": [...], "#type": "List<Number>"}`
   â”‚           - `{"#literal": 42, "#type": "Int"}`
