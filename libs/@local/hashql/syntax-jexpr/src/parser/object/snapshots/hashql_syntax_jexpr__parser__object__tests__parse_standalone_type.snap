error[parser::object::orphaned-type]: Orphaned #type field without parent construct
  ╭▸ 
1 │ {"#type": "Int"}
  │  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Add a primary construct to use with #type
  │
  ├ help: The `#type` field must be used alongside a primary construct like `#struct`, `#list`, etc. It cannot be used alone in an object.
  ╰ note: The `#type` field is used to annotate the type of a construct. Valid examples include:
              - `{"#struct": {...}, "#type": "Person"}`
              - `{"#list": [...], "#type": "List<Number>"}`
              - `{"#literal": 42, "#type": "Int"}`
