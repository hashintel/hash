error[parser::object::struct-expected-object]: Expected object for #struct definition

  ├ help: The #struct construct requires an object with field definitions, but found `[`. Use curly braces to define the struct fields: {"field1": value1, "field2": value2}
  ╰ note: Structs in J-Expr represent collections of named fields, where each field can have a different type.
