error[parser::object::type-expected-string]: Expected string for type definition

  ├ help: Found `[`, which is not a valid type specification. Types must be represented as a string.
  ╰ note: Types in J-Expr must be specified through an embedded language represented in a string that mimics that of Rust and TypeScript. See the language documentation for more details.
