///
/// Body operations form a processing pipeline where:
/// 1. Data flows from the head operation through each body operation in sequence
/// 2. Each operation can filter, transform, or enrich the data stream

/// # Result Processing
///
/// Tail operations handle the final transformation of the data stream into

/// - Aggregate multiple items into collections
/// - Apply final transformations or formatting
/// - Handle empty result sets appropriately
