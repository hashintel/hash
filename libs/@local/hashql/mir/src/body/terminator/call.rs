/// A function call terminator in the HashQL MIR.
///
/// Call terminators represent function invocations that have control flow
/// implications. Unlike simple expressions, calls in terminator position
/// can affect control flow by potentially not returning (in case of exceptions
/// or divergence) or by transferring control to a continuation block after
/// the call completes.
///
/// # Call Semantics
///
/// When executed, a call terminator:
/// 1. Evaluates the function operand to determine the target function
/// 2. Evaluates all argument operands to prepare the call parameters
/// 3. Invokes the target function with the provided arguments
/// 4. Upon successful return, transfers control to the target basic block
/// 5. The return values become available for use in the target block
///
/// # Control Flow Implications
///
/// Call terminators can affect control flow in several ways:
/// - **Normal Return**: Control transfers to the target block with return values
