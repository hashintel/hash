    ///
    /// Used with [`Projection::Field`] for:
    /// - Tuple elements (e.g., `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`)

/// Each projection represents a single step in navigating from one level of nesting
/// to another.
///
/// # Access Methods
///
/// - **Positional Access**: [`Field`] uses indices for closed/complete types
/// - **Name-based Access**: [`FieldByName`] uses symbols for structural/partial types
/// - **Dynamic Access**: [`Index`] uses computed values for collections
///
/// [`Field`]: Projection::Field
/// [`FieldByName`]: Projection::FieldByName
/// [`Index`]: Projection::Index
