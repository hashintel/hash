//! Operand representation for HashQL MIR.

/// Operands represent the input values for MIR operations such as assignments,

/// # Usage in MIR
///
/// Operands are used throughout the MIR to represent:
/// - Arguments to function calls
/// - Inputs to binary and unary operations
/// - Source values in assignment statements
/// - Indices for array/field access
