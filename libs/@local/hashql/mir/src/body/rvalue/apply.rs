/// - **Function**: The [`Operand`] that evaluates to the callable function
/// - **Arguments**: An ordered collection of [`Operand`]s representing the arguments
///
/// # Execution Semantics
///
/// During execution, the function operand is evaluated first to obtain the callable,
/// then each argument operand is evaluated in order, and finally the function is
/// invoked with the computed argument values.
