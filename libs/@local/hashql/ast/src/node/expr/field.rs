/// A field access expression in the HashQL Abstract Syntax Tree.

/// Represents accessing a named field from a composite value such as a struct,

/// members of container types.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## J-Expr
///
/// ```json
/// [".", "user", "name"]
/// ["user.name"]
/// ```
///
/// ## Documentation Format

/// ```text
/// user.name
