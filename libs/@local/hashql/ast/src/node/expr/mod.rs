//! Expression nodes for the HashQL Abstract Syntax Tree.
//!
//! This module defines all expression types used in HashQL, a side-effect free, purely
//! functional programming language for querying bi-temporal graphs. The expressions are
//! organized into a hierarchy, with [`Expr`] at the root containing various specific
//! expression kinds represented by the [`ExprKind`] enum.
//!
//! # Special Forms
//!
//! Several expression kinds (`Let`, `Use`, `Input`, `Closure`, `If`, `Field`, `Index`) are
//! implemented as "special forms". Initially, these are parsed as ordinary function calls into the
//! AST. During a subsequent AST transformation phase, these function calls are recognized by their
//! names and expanded into their corresponding specialized AST nodes. For example, a `let`
//! function call is transformed into a dedicated [`LetExpr`] structure in the AST after parsing.
//!
//! # Memory Management
//!
//! The AST is designed to work with arena allocation through the `'heap` lifetime,
//! which references the memory region where nodes are allocated. This approach
//! improves performance by minimizing allocations and deallocations during parsing
//! and evaluation.
//!
//! Unlike other steps, in which the AST is interned in a "real" arena allocator, the AST is using
//! `Box` to manage memory instead. This is important as some of the steps in the AST require that
//! we do not deduplicate nodes yet. This makes each node in the tree larger, but also has the
//! side-effect of easier access of the tree.
//!
//! # Node Identification and Source Location
//!
//! Each expression node has a unique identifier (`id`) that can be used to track the node through
//! various processing stages. Additionally, nodes carry a span identifier (`span`) that points to
//! the location of the expression in the source code, facilitating error reporting and debugging.
//!
//! # Frontend
//!
//! While the AST itself is frontend-independent, the examples shown in this documentation use
//! `JExpr`, which is a JSON-based syntax for HashQL. Other frontends may be added in the future,
//! all mapping to this same core AST structure.
