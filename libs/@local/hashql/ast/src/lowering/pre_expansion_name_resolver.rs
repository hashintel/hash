//! Name resolution for the HashQL Abstract Syntax Tree.
//!
//! This module provides functionality for resolving identifiers in the AST to their fully
//! qualified paths. It handles path resolution, scoping rules, and special form detection
//! for constructs like `let`, `type`, and `newtype`.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Name resolution is a critical part of the HashQL compilation pipeline, converting:
//!
//! - Unqualified identifiers (`map`) to absolute paths (`::graph::body::map`)
//! - Operators (`+`) to their function equivalents (`::math::add`)
//! - Special forms to their kernel representations (`let` to `::kernel::special_form::let`)
//!
//! The resolver also manages scoping rules to ensure that bindings from `let`, `type`, and
//! `newtype` expressions only apply within their respective bodies.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The name resolver works as a visitor pattern implementation that traverses the AST and:
//!
//! 1. Maintains a mapping of identifiers to their absolute paths
//! 2. Applies transformations to convert relative paths to absolute ones
//! 3. Recognizes special forms and establishes proper scoping for bindings
//! 4. Preserves source location information during transformations
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Input AST:
//! ```json
//! ["let", "x", "10", ["+", "x", "5"]]
//! ```
//!
//! After name resolution:
//! ```json
//! ["::kernel::special_form::let", "x", "10", ["::math::add", "10", "5"]]
//! ```
//!
//! # Special Forms
//!
//! The resolver recognizes and properly processes several special forms:
//!
//! - **let**: Binds a value to a name within a scope
//!   - `let/3`: `[let, name, value, body]`
//!   - `let/4`: `[let, name, type, value, body]`
//!
//! - **type**: Defines a type alias within a scope
//!   - `type/3`: `[type, name, underlying_type, body]`
//!
//! - **newtype**: Defines a new nominal type based on an existing type
//!   - `newtype/3`: `[newtype, name, underlying_type, body]`
//!
//! # Path Resolution Behavior
//!
//! When processing paths, the resolver follows these rules:
//!
//! 1. Absolute paths (starting with `::`) remain unchanged
//! 2. Unrooted paths are checked against the current name mapping
//! 3. If the first segment matches an entry in the mapping, it's replaced with the absolute path
//! 4. Generic arguments are preserved during path resolution
//! 5. Source location information is maintained for error reporting
//!
//! # Selective Tree Resolution and Scope Separation
//!
//! The name resolver intentionally processes only specific parts of the AST:
//!
//! 1. We only resolve the function name.
//! 2. For `let` expressions, only the value of the binding is resolved.
//!
//! This selective approach is intentionally conservative and critical because:
//!
//! - It prepares the AST specifically for special form expansion, which only takes the function
//!   name into account.
//! - It maintains a strict separation between value and type scopes, which don't share the same
//!   identifier resolutions.
//! - The function called can only ever be a value, never a type, so we ensure consistent handling.
//!
//! By deliberately restricting name resolution to only the necessary parts of the tree, the
//! resolver prevents scope contamination and ensures correct expansion in subsequent compilation
//! phases. This conservative approach to resolution helps avoid unintended transformations that
//! could lead to subtle errors in later processing stages.
//!
//! # Scoping Rules
//!
//! The resolver enforces lexical scoping rules:
//!
//! 1. Bindings only apply within their defined scope (body of let/type/newtype expressions)
//! 2. Inner bindings shadow outer bindings with the same name
//! 3. Original bindings are restored when exiting a scope
//! 4. Built-in names can be shadowed by local bindings

/// Resolves name aliases in the HashQL AST, converting identifiers to their absolute path
/// representation.
///
/// The `NameResolver` performs several key functions during AST processing:
///
/// 1. Path Resolution: Converts unrooted paths (like `map`) to their absolute forms (like
///    `::graph::body::map`)
/// 2. Special Form Handling: Recognizes and processes special forms like `let`, `type`, and
///    `newtype`, but does **not** transform them yet.
/// 3. Scope Management: Maintains proper lexical scoping of bindings within expressions
/// 4. Selective Value-Scope Resolution: Only resolves specific parts of the AST (binding values and
///    function identifiers) to maintain strict separation between value and type scopes
///
/// # Example
///
/// The name resolver converts expressions like:
/// ```json
/// ["let", "x", "10", ["+", "x", "5"]]
/// ```
///
/// Into their resolved forms:
/// ```json
/// [
///     "::kernel::special_form::let",
///     "x",
///     "10",
///     ["::math::add", "10", "5"],
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// Note that the identifier `x` in the binding position (first argument) is preserved exactly as
/// written, while its use in the body expression is resolved according to the current scope.
