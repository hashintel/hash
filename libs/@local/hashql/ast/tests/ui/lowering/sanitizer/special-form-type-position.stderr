   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Help: The special form 'let' must be called directly with arguments. It cannot be used as a type annotation or declaration or passed to other functions. Instead, use it in a direct function call syntax.
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: Special forms in HashQL are compile-time constructs that must be expanded during compilation. They can only be used in call position with their expected arguments, not as regular values, types, or function references.
