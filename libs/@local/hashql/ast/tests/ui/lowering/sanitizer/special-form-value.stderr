   │                 ╰─────────────── Special form cannot be used as a value
   │ 
   │ Help: The special form 'let' must be called directly with arguments. It cannot be used as a value expression or passed to other functions. Instead, use it in a direct function call syntax.
   │ 
   │ Note: Special forms in HashQL are compile-time constructs that must be expanded during compilation. They can only be used in call position with their expected arguments, not as regular values, types, or function references.
