  ├ help: Field access using numeric literals cannot have type annotations. The literal represents the field index directly and doesn't need a separate type.
  ╰ note: When using numeric literals for field access (e.g., in tuple destructuring), the number itself indicates the position and cannot be annotated with a type.
