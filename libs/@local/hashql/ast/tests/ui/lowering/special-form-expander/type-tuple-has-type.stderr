   │ 
   │ Help: Type expressions used in special forms cannot have their own type annotations. The expression itself defines a type and cannot be annotated with another type.
   │ 
   │ Note: When constructing type expressions for special forms like 'type', 'newtype', or 'as', the expression itself represents a type definition and cannot have a separate type annotation.
