  ├ help: Function generics declarations cannot have type annotations. Generic parameter lists define type parameters for the function, and do not have a meaningful type themselves.
  ╰ note: In the 'fn' special form, the generics argument should be either a tuple of identifiers such as (T, U) or a struct of bounded type parameters such as (T: SomeBound, U: OtherBound, V: _), where an underscore indicates no bound.
