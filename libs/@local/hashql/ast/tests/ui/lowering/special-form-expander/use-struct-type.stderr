  ├ help: Use import expressions cannot have type annotations. Import expressions define which symbols to import, and do not have a meaningful type in this context.
  ╰ note: Import expressions in the 'use' special form can only be a glob (*), a tuple of identifiers, or a struct of bindings, none of which should have type annotations.
