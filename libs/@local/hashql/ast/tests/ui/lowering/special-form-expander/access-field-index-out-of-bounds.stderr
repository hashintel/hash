   │ 
   │ Help: Field indices must be non-negative integers that fit within the bounds of usize. Very large numbers or negative numbers cannot be used as field indices.
   │ 
   │ Note: Field indexing in HashQL uses zero-based indexing where the first field is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. The maximum valid index depends on the system's architecture, which is 64-bit.
