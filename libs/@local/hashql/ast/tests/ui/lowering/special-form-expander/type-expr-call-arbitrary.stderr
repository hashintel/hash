   │            ╰───────── This function cannot be used as a type constructor
   │ 
   │ Help: Only specific type constructors like intersection (&) and union (|) operators can be used in type expressions.
   │ 
   │ Note: Currently supported type operations are:
   │       - Intersection: math::bit_and (written as & in source)
   │       - Union: math::bit_or (written as | in source)
