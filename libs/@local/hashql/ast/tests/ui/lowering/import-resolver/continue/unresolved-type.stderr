   │ 
   │ Help: The name 'T' doesn't exist in this scope.
   │       
   │       Did you mean one of these local variables:
   │         - Foo
   │       
   │       Or perhaps you meant one of these imported items:
   │         - Result
   │         - Some
   │         - String
   │         - Unknown
   │         - Url
   │         (14 more available)
   │ 
   │ Note: Variables must be defined before they can be used. This could be a typo, a variable used outside its scope, or a missing declaration. If it's a function or type from another module, you might need to import it first.
