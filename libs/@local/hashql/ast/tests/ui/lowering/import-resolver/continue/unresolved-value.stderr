   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Help: The name 'bit_shl' doesn't exist in this scope.
   â”‚       
   â”‚       Items with a similar name exist in other modules:
   â”‚         - ::math::bit_shl
   â”‚       
   â”‚       To use an item, you can either:
   â”‚         1. Import it: use ::math::bit_shl in
   â”‚         2. Use fully qualified path: ::math::bit_shl
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: Variables must be defined before they can be used. This could be a typo, a variable used outside its scope, or a missing declaration. If it's a function or type from another module, you might need to import it first.
