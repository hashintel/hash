   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Help: The name 'bit_shl' doesn't exist in this scope.
   â”‚       
   â”‚       Perhaps you meant one of these imported items?
   â”‚         - `List`
   â”‚         - `Dict`
   â”‚         - `cbrt`
   â”‚         - and 48 more imported items
   â”‚       
   â”‚       Additionally, items with a similar name exist in other modules:
   â”‚         - `::math::bit_shl`
   â”‚       
   â”‚       To use an item like `::math::bit_shl`, you can either:
   â”‚       1. Add an import at the beginning of your file:
   â”‚            use ::math::bit_shl in
   â”‚       2. Use its fully qualified path directly in your code:
   â”‚            ::math::bit_shl
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: Variables must be defined before they can be used. This could be a typo, a variable used outside its scope, or a missing declaration. If it's a function or type from another module, you might need to import it first.
