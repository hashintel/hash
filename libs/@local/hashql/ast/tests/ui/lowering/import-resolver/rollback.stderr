   │     ╰─── Cannot find variable 'shl'
   │ 
   │ Help: The name 'shl' doesn't exist in this scope.
   │       
   │       Items with a similar name exist in other modules:
   │         - ::core::bits::shl
   │       
   │       To use an item, you can either:
   │         1. Import it: use ::core::bits::shl in
   │         2. Use fully qualified path: ::core::bits::shl
   │ 
   │ Note: Variables must be defined before they can be used. This could be a typo, a variable used outside its scope, or a missing declaration. If it's a function or type from another module, you might need to import it first.
