//! Object pooling primitives for efficient resource management.
//!
//! This module provides a generic object pool implementation that allows for efficient
//! reuse of expensive-to-create objects. The pool system is built around the [`Recycler`]
//! trait, which defines how objects are cleaned up, created, and prepared for reuse.
//!
//! The primary benefit of object pooling is reducing allocation overhead by reusing
//! objects instead of constantly allocating and deallocating them. This is particularly
//! valuable for objects that are:
//! - Expensive to allocate (e.g., large vectors, complex data structures)
//! - Used frequently in hot code paths
//! - Short-lived but numerous
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The pooling system consists of three main components:
//!
//! 1. [`Pool<T, R>`] - The main pool structure that manages object storage and lifecycle
//! 2. [`Recycler<T>`] - A trait that defines how to clean, create, and prepare objects
//! 3. Concrete recyclers like [`VecRecycler`] and [`MixedBitSetRecycler`]
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage with vector pooling:
//!
//! ```
//! use hashql_core::collections::pool::{VecPool, VecRecycler};
//!
//! let mut pool = VecPool::<i32>::new(10); // Pool with capacity of 10
//!
//! // Acquire a vector with initial capacity of 100
//! let mut vec = pool.acquire_with(100);
//! vec.extend([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
//!
//! // Use the vector...
//! assert_eq!(vec.len(), 5);
//!
//! // Return it to the pool for reuse
//! pool.release(vec);
//!
//! // Next acquisition will reuse the same vector (now cleared)
//! let vec2 = pool.acquire_with(50);
//! assert_eq!(vec2.len(), 0);
//! ```

/// Trait for defining how objects are recycled, created, and prepared in a pool.
///
/// This trait provides the core lifecycle management for pooled objects. Implementors
/// define how to clean objects for reuse, create new objects when the pool is empty,
/// and prepare existing objects with specific configurations.
///
/// The `Config` associated type allows for parameterized object creation and preparation,
/// enabling pools to handle objects that need different initialization parameters.
///
/// # Implementation Guidelines
///
/// When implementing this trait:
/// - [`recycle`] should reset the object to a clean, reusable state
/// - [`acquire`] should create a new object with the given configuration
/// - [`prepare`] should configure an existing object for reuse with new parameters
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Implementing a recycler for a custom data structure:
///
/// ```
/// use hashql_core::collections::pool::Recycler;
///

/// struct MyBuffer {

///     threshold: usize,

/// impl Recycler<MyBuffer> for MyBufferRecycler {

///     fn recycle(&mut self, item: &mut MyBuffer) {
///         item.data.clear(); // Reset data but preserve capacity
///     }

///     fn acquire(&mut self, threshold: usize) -> MyBuffer {

/// A generic object pool for efficient resource reuse.
///
/// `Pool<T, R>` manages a collection of reusable objects of type `T` using a recycler
/// of type `R` that implements [`Recycler<T>`]. The pool maintains an internal free
/// list of available objects and provides methods to acquire objects for use and
/// release them back to the pool.
///
/// The pool has a configurable capacity that limits the number of objects kept in
/// the free list. When objects are released to a full pool, they are simply dropped
/// rather than stored, preventing unbounded memory growth.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T` - The type of objects being pooled
/// - `R` - The recycler type that implements [`Recycler<T>`]
///
/// # Memory Management
///
/// Objects in the pool are stored in a [`Vec`] which may have capacity greater than
/// the pool's configured capacity for efficiency. The pool will only grow the
/// underlying vector when necessary and will truncate it when the capacity is reduced.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Creating and using a basic pool:
///
/// ```
/// use hashql_core::collections::pool::{Pool, VecRecycler};
///
/// let mut pool = Pool::with_recycler(5, VecRecycler::default());
///
/// // Acquire objects
/// let mut vec1 = pool.acquire_with(100);
/// let mut vec2 = pool.acquire_with(200);
///
/// // Use the objects
/// vec1.push(42);
/// vec2.extend([1, 2, 3]);
///
/// // Return them to the pool
/// pool.release(vec1);
/// pool.release(vec2);
///
/// // Pool now contains 2 recycled vectors ready for reuse
