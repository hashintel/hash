//! Source code span tracking and management system.
//!
//! This module provides a compact and efficient system for tracking locations within source code.
//! It is designed around two core concepts: [`SpanId`] for lightweight span identification and
//! [`SpanTable`] for storing and resolving actual span data.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The span system uses an indirection-based approach where [`SpanId`] serves as a compact
//! identifier that references span data stored in a [`SpanTable`].
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - **[`SpanId`]**: A compact 4-byte identifier for spans
//! - **[`SpanTable`]**: Storage and resolution for span data
//! - **[`Span`]**: Trait for types that can represent text ranges
//! - **[`Spanned<T>`]**: Wrapper that associates values with their source spans
//! - **[`SpanAncestors`]**: Represents hierarchical relationships between spans
//!
//! # Span Hierarchy and Resolution
//!
//! Spans can have ancestor relationships, which allows for hierarchical source tracking. This is
//! used in various phases to layer additional information onto a span.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hashql_core::span::{Span, SpanAncestors, SpanTable, TextRange};
//! use hashql_diagnostics::source::SourceId;
//!
//! # struct MySpan { range: TextRange }
//! # impl hashql_core::span::Span for MySpan {
//! #     fn range(&self) -> TextRange { self.range }
//! # }
//! let source_id = SourceId::new_unchecked(0);
//! let mut table = SpanTable::new(source_id);
//!
//! // Create a root span
//! let root_span = MySpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(0.into(), 100.into()),
//! };
//! let root_id = table.insert(root_span, SpanAncestors::empty());
//!
//! // Create a child span with the root as ancestor
//! let child_span = MySpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(10.into(), 20.into()),
//! };
//! let child_id = table.insert(child_span, SpanAncestors::union(&[root_id]));
//! ```
//!
//! # Comparison with Other Span Systems
//!
//! ## rust-analyzer
//!
//! rust-analyzer uses direct [`TextRange`] representations during parsing, later
//! converting to more complex span types. Our system uses indirection from the start,
//! trading some lookup overhead for significantly better memory efficiency.
//!
//! ## rustc
//!
//! rustc uses an 8-byte span that attempts to inline span data for 99.9%+ of cases,
//! falling back to interned storage for complex spans. Our approach uses consistent
//! indirection, making it simpler but potentially less cache-efficient for simple cases.
//!
//! Our design prioritizes:
//! - **Simplicity**: Consistent indirection model
//! - **Compactness**: 4-byte identifiers vs rustc's 8-byte spans
//! - **Flexibility**: Easy ancestor chain manipulation and resolution modes
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Span Creation and Lookup
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hashql_core::span::{Span, SpanAncestors, SpanTable, TextRange};
//! use hashql_diagnostics::source::SourceId;
//!
//! # struct SimpleSpan { range: TextRange }
//! # impl hashql_core::span::Span for SimpleSpan {
//! #     fn range(&self) -> TextRange { self.range }
//! # }
//! let source_id = SourceId::new_unchecked(1);
//! let mut table = SpanTable::new(source_id);
//!
//! let span = SimpleSpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(0.into(), 42.into()),
//! };
//! let span_id = table.insert(span, SpanAncestors::empty());
//!
//! // Later lookup
//! let retrieved_span = table.get(span_id).expect("span exists");
//! assert_eq!(retrieved_span.range(), TextRange::new(0.into(), 42.into()));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hierarchical Spans with Union Resolution
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hashql_core::span::{Span, SpanAncestors, SpanResolutionMode, SpanTable, TextRange};
//! use hashql_diagnostics::source::SourceId;
//!
//! # struct MySpan { range: TextRange }
//! # impl hashql_core::span::Span for MySpan {
//! #     fn range(&self) -> TextRange { self.range }
//! # }
//! let source_id = SourceId::new_unchecked(2);
//! let mut table = SpanTable::new(source_id);
//!
//! // Create base spans
//! let span_a = MySpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(10.into(), 20.into()),
//! };
//! let span_b = MySpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(30.into(), 40.into()),
//! };
//! let span_a_id = table.insert(span_a, SpanAncestors::empty());
//! let span_b_id = table.insert(span_b, SpanAncestors::empty());
//!
//! // Create a span that unions both ancestors
//! let child_span = MySpan {
//!     range: TextRange::new(5.into(), 15.into()),
//! };
//! let ancestor_ids = [span_a_id, span_b_id];
//! let ancestors = SpanAncestors::union(&ancestor_ids);
//! let child_id = table.insert(child_span, ancestors);
//!
//! // The absolute range will be the union of all ancestors plus the child's offset
//! let absolute = table.absolute(child_id).expect("span resolution succeeds");
//! // Result covers the union of spans A and B, plus child's relative range
//! assert_eq!(absolute.range(), TextRange::new(15.into(), 25.into()));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Synthetic Spans for Generated Code
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hashql_core::span::SpanId;
//!
//! // Use SYNTHETIC for compiler-generated constructs
//! let synthetic_span = SpanId::SYNTHETIC;
//! assert_eq!(synthetic_span.to_string(), "4294967295"); // u32::MAX
//!
//! // Diagnostic renderers can handle synthetic spans specially
//! // (e.g., omit location, show as "generated", etc.)
//! ```

pub use self::table::SpanTable;

/// Represents a unique identifier for a span in some source.
///
/// [`SpanId`] serves as a compact, opaque identifier that references span data stored in a
/// [`SpanTable`].
///
/// The span itself might represent various forms of source locations:
/// - Byte offsets in text files
/// - Line/column positions
/// - JSON Pointers for structured data
/// - Synthetic locations for compiler-generated code
///
/// # Memory Layout and Encoding
///
/// [`SpanId`] uses a 4-byte layout to maximize information density:
///
/// ```text
/// 0                   1                   2                   3
/// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
/// +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
/// |                     ID                    |       Source      |
/// +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
/// ```
///
/// The last 12 bits are used to encode the source file index, whereas the first 20 bits are used to
/// encode the span offset within the source file.
///
/// This encoding provides us with:
/// - 2^12 = 4096 source files
/// - 2^20 = 1.048.576 spans per source file
///
/// This tradeoff was chosen to maximize information density while maintaining a reasonable number
/// of source files and spans per file. Given that each identifier is ~3 bytes long it would mean
/// that the maximum number of spans would be 3MiB. In reality that number would be much larger due
/// to e.g. whitespace and comments.
///
/// We encode the source id inside the span id to ensure that we cannot wrongly index a
/// [`SpanTable`] with a [`SourceId`] or have ancestors that span across multiple source files.
///
/// ## Compactness Benefits
///
/// At only 4 bytes, [`SpanId`] can be embedded efficiently in:
/// - Node structures
/// - Token representations
/// - Type information
/// - Error and diagnostic contexts
/// - Any frequently-allocated data structure
///
/// This compactness is crucial for compiler performance, as spans are pervasive
/// throughout the compilation process.
///
/// # Usage Patterns
///
/// [`SpanId`] is designed as a reference type - the actual span information must be
/// retrieved from the corresponding [`SpanTable`]. This separation enables:
///
/// - **Shared ownership**: Multiple nodes can reference the same span
/// - **Lazy resolution**: Span details are only looked up when needed
/// - **Batch operations**: Multiple spans can be resolved efficiently together
/// - **Memory deduplication**: Identical spans can be stored once and referenced multiple times
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Basic usage with span table lookup:
///
/// ```rust
/// use hashql_core::span::{Span, SpanAncestors, SpanTable, TextRange};
/// use hashql_diagnostics::source::SourceId;
///
/// # struct SimpleSpan { range: TextRange }
/// # impl hashql_core::span::Span for SimpleSpan {
/// #     fn range(&self) -> TextRange { self.range }
/// # }
/// let source_id = SourceId::new_unchecked(1);
/// let mut table = SpanTable::new(source_id);
///
/// let span = SimpleSpan {
///     range: TextRange::new(0.into(), 42.into()),
/// };
/// let span_id = table.insert(span, SpanAncestors::empty());
///
/// // Later lookup
/// let retrieved_span = table.get(span_id).expect("span exists");
/// assert_eq!(retrieved_span.range(), TextRange::new(0.into(), 42.into()));
/// ```
///
/// Using synthetic spans for generated code:
///
/// ```rust
/// use hashql_core::span::SpanId;
///
/// let synthetic = SpanId::SYNTHETIC;
///
/// // Synthetic spans have special meaning for diagnostic renderers
/// // They might be displayed as "<generated>" or omitted from output
/// println!("Synthetic span ID: {}", synthetic);
/// ```
///
/// Extracting source ID and span index components:
///
/// ```rust
/// use hashql_core::span::{Span, SpanAncestors, SpanId, SpanTable, TextRange};
/// use hashql_diagnostics::source::SourceId;
///
/// # struct MySpan { range: TextRange }
/// # impl Span for MySpan {
/// #     fn range(&self) -> TextRange {
/// #         TextRange::new(0.into(), 10.into())
/// #     }
/// # }
/// let source_id = SourceId::new_unchecked(5);
/// let mut table = SpanTable::new(source_id);
///
/// let span_data = MySpan {
///     range: TextRange::new(0.into(), 10.into()),
/// };
/// let span_id = table.insert(span_data, SpanAncestors::empty());
///
/// // Verify span was inserted successfully
/// assert_eq!(
///     table.get(span_id).map(|span| span.range()),
///     Some(TextRange::new(0.into(), 10.into()))
/// );
/// ```

///
/// The [`range`](Span::range) method returns a **relative** range within the
/// span's immediate parent. For absolute source positions, use
/// [`SpanTable::absolute`] which handles the full ancestor chain resolution.

/// ## Implementation Guidelines
///
/// - **Consistency**: The range should be stable for the lifetime of the span
/// - **Relativity**: Ranges are relative to the parent span, not absolute file positions
