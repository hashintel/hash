    /// This method returns `true` when both types in the relationship have been observed in
    /// a recursive cycle (both `lhs` and `rhs` flags are true). This dual-recursion requirement

    /// 1. We only discharge cycles when we have a genuine recursive relationship on both sides,
    ///    preventing unsound conclusions when only one type is recursive.
    ///
    /// 2. The coinductive hypothesis is correctly applied, following formal bisimulation principles
    ///    where we assume the relationship holds if the non-recursive parts are consistent.
    ///
    /// 3. The check maintains soundness in the type system by avoiding premature discharge in
    ///    complex type relationships where one side is non-recursive.
