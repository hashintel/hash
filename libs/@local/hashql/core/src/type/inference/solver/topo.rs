/// Performs a topological sort on a directed graph using Kahn's algorithm.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// Kahn's algorithm works by repeatedly removing nodes that have no incoming edges
/// (no dependencies) and adding them to the result order. As nodes are removed, their
/// outgoing edges are also removed, potentially creating new nodes with no dependencies.
///
/// 1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node
/// 2. Identify nodes with zero in-degree (no dependencies) and add them to a queue
/// 3. While the queue is not empty:
///    1. Remove a node from the queue and add it to the result order.
///    2. For each neighbor of the removed node, decrement its in-degree.
///    3. If any neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.
/// 4. If all nodes are processed, return the order
/// 5. Otherwise, there must be a cycle, so identify and return nodes in the cycle
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Given that `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges in the graph:
///
/// * Time Complexity `O(V + E)`
/// * Space Complexity `O(V)`
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Ok(Vec<usize>)` - A vector of node indices in topological order if the graph is acyclic.
///   Nodes with no dependencies appear before nodes that depend on them.
///
/// - `Err(RoaringBitmap)` - A bitmap containing the indices of nodes involved in cycles if the
///   graph contains one or more cycles.
