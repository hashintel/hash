//! Symbol representation and manipulation for HashQL.
//!
//! This module defines dedicated types for representing symbols in HashQL's compilation process.
//! Symbols are string-like values that appear in source code, such as identifiers, keywords,
//! and literals. They are deliberately kept separate from the syntax tree as they are used through
//! the different stages of compilation.
//!
//! The module provides:
//!
//! - [`Symbol`]: An opaque wrapper around string data that enables efficient storage and comparison
//! - [`Ident`]: A named identifier with source location and categorization
//! - [`IdentKind`]: Classification of different identifier types in HashQL
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! The [`Symbol`] type is designed as an opaque wrapper around its internal string storage.
//! This encapsulation enables future optimizations such as string interning (either through
//! the `string_interner` crate or a custom implementation) without requiring API changes.
