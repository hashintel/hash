   ├ help: rewrite the logic to avoid conditional statements
   ├ note: conditional statements (`if`/`else`) are not supported by the current query compiler. This is a fundamental limitation that will be addressed in the next-generation compiler
   ╰ note: conditional logic must be handled outside the query or using other language constructs
