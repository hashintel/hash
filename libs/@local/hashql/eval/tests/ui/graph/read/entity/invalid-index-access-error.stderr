   ├ help: This is an internal compiler error. The index access should have been validated by the type checker, but the operation failed during compilation. Please report this as a bug with the code that triggered this error.
   ├ note: This error indicates a bug in the type checker or compiler. The index access was expected to succeed based on type information, but failed during evaluation.
   ├ note: Internal error that occurred: Unable to access list with index type `string`
   ├ help: This is a bug in the compiler, not an issue with your code.
   ├ help: Please report this issue along with a minimal code example that reproduces the error.
   ╰ note: Internal compiler errors indicate a bug in the compiler itself that needs to be fixed.
