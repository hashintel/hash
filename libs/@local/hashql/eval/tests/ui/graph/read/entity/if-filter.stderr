  ├ help: rewrite the logic to avoid conditional statements
  ├ note: conditional statements (`if`/`else`) are not supported by the current query compiler. This is a fundamental limitation that will be addressed in the next-generation compiler
  ╰ note: consider using boolean operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to combine conditions directly instead of `if` statements
