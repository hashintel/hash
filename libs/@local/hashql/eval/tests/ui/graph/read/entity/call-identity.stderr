   ├ help: Filter expressions do not currently support function calls. Move the function call outside the filter expression, assign the result to a variable, and use that variable in the filter instead.
   ╰ note: Function calls in filter expressions are not yet implemented. This feature may be added in future versions for specific categories of pure functions. Progress is tracked in https://linear.app/hash/issue/H-4913/hashql-implement-vm.
