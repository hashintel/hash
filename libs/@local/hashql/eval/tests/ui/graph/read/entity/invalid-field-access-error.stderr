    │             ╰── Field access for `ID` failed unexpectedly
    │ 
    │ Help 1: This is an internal compiler error. The field access should have been validated by the type checker, but the operation failed during compilation. Please report this as a bug with the code that triggered this error.
    │ 
    │ Help 2: This is a bug in the compiler, not an issue with your code.
    │ 
    │ Help 3: Please report this issue along with a minimal code example that reproduces the error.
    │ 
    │ Note 1: This error indicates a bug in the type checker or compiler. The field access was expected to succeed based on type information, but failed during evaluation.
    │ 
    │ Note 2: Internal error that occurred: Field `ID` not found
    │ 
    │ Note 3: Internal compiler errors indicate a bug in the compiler itself that needs to be fixed.
    │         
    │         We would appreciate if you could file a GitHub or Linear issue and reference this error.
    │
