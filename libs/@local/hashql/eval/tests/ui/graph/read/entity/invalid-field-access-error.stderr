   ├ help: This is an internal compiler error. The field access should have been validated by the type checker, but the operation failed during compilation. Please report this as a bug with the code that triggered this error.
   ├ note: This error indicates a bug in the type checker or compiler. The field access was expected to succeed based on type information, but failed during evaluation.
   ├ note: Internal error that occurred: Field `ID` not found
   ├ help: This is a bug in the compiler, not an issue with your code.
   ├ help: Please report this issue along with a minimal code example that reproduces the error.
