    │     Help: Constructor functions cannot currently be used as first-class values in filter expressions. You can still call constructors to create values (e.g., `SomeType(x)`), but you cannot use the constructor itself in comparisons or pass it as an argument within filter contexts.
    │     
    │     Note: This is a current limitation of the filter expression compiler. Constructors work as first-class values elsewhere in the language, and support for this in filter expressions is being tracked in https://linear.app/hash/issue/H-4913/hashql-implement-vm.
