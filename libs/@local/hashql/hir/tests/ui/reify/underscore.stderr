3 │ "_"
  │  ━ `_` not allowed here
  │
  ├ help: In expressions, `_` can only be used on the left-hand side of an assignment.
  ╰ note: The underscore symbol `_` is a special placeholder that can only be used in specific contexts. Currently, it's only valid as an assignment target, not as a value in expressions.
