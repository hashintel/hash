 3 │ "_"
   │  ┬  
   │  ╰── `_` not allowed here
   │ 
   │ Help: In expressions, `_` can only be used on the left-hand side of an assignment.
   │ 
   │ Note: The underscore symbol `_` is a special placeholder that can only be used in specific contexts. Currently, it's only valid as an assignment target, not as a value in expressions.
