error[type-check::unconstrained-type-variable]: Unconstrained type variable
  ╭▸ 
4 │   "#list": []
  │            ━━ Cannot infer type for this variable - no usage constraints available

  ├ help: Add an explicit type annotation to provide the necessary context. For example:
  │       - Change `let x = ...` to `let x: Type = ...`
  │       - Provide type parameters like `function<T: SomeType>(...)`
  │       - Use the value in a way that constrains its type
  ╰ note: Type inference needs constraints that come from how variables are used. When a variable lacks both usage context and explicit annotations, the type system cannot determine an appropriate type. This commonly occurs with empty collections, unused variables, or generic functions without type annotations.
