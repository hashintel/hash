   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Help: These type bounds create an impossible constraint. To fix this:
   â”‚       1. Modify `[34mString[0m` to be a proper subtype of `[34mNumber[0m`
   â”‚       2. Or adjust `[34mNumber[0m` to be a supertype of `[34mString[0m`
   â”‚       3. Or check your code for contradictory type assertions
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: During type inference, when a variable has both upper and lower bounds, the relationship 'lower <: upper' must hold. This ensures a valid solution exists in the type system. When this relationship is violated, it means your code is requiring contradictory types for the same variable.
