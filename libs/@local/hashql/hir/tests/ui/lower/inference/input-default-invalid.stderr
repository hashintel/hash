   │               ╰── Type variable has incompatible upper and lower bounds
   │ 
   │ Help: These type bounds create an impossible constraint. To fix this:
   │       1. Modify `String` to be a proper subtype of `Number`
   │       2. Or adjust `Number` to be a supertype of `String`
   │       3. Or check your code for contradictory type assertions
   │ 
   │ Note: During type inference, when a variable has both upper and lower bounds, the relationship 'lower <: upper' must hold. This ensures a valid solution exists in the type system. When this relationship is violated, it means your code is requiring contradictory types for the same variable.
