    │       Help: To fix this conflict, you can:
    │             1. Change the equality constraint `?` to be a subtype of the upper bound
    │             2. Adjust the upper bound `Number` to be a supertype of the equality constraint
    │             3. Review your type annotations to ensure they're consistent
    │       
    │       Note: Type inference requires that when a variable has both an equality constraint and an upper bound, the equality type must be a subtype of the upper bound (equal <: upper). This error indicates your code has contradictory requirements for the same type variable.
