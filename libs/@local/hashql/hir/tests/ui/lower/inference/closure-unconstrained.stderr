   │ ┗━━━Type variable has incompatible equality and upper bound constraints
   │     Required to be exactly `?`
   │
   ├ help: To fix this conflict, you can:
   │       1. Change the equality constraint `?` to be a subtype of the upper bound
   │       2. Adjust the upper bound `Number` to be a supertype of the equality constraint
   │       3. Review your type annotations to ensure they're consistent
   ╰ note: Type inference requires that when a variable has both an equality constraint and an upper bound, the equality type must be a subtype of the upper bound (equal <: upper). This error indicates your code has contradictory requirements for the same type variable.
