   â”‚ Help: The 'Never' type represents computations that don't return. It's a subtype of all types but no type is a subtype of it (except itself).
   â”‚ 
   â”‚ Note: This type system uses a combination of nominal and structural typing. Types are compatible when they have the same structure (same fields/elements with compatible types) or when they represent the same named type. Union types must have at least one compatible variant, and intersection types require all constraints to be satisfied.
