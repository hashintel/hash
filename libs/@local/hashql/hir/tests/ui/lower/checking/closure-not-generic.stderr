    │            ╰───────── Type variable has incompatible upper and lower bounds
    │ 
    │ Help: These type bounds create an impossible constraint. To fix this:
    │       1. Modify `([93m?14[0m | [93m?13[0m)` to be a proper subtype of `[34mNumber[0m`
    │       2. Or adjust `[34mNumber[0m` to be a supertype of `([93m?14[0m | [93m?13[0m)`
    │       3. Or check your code for contradictory type assertions
    │ 
    │ Note: During type inference, when a variable has both upper and lower bounds, the relationship 'lower <: upper' must hold. This ensures a valid solution exists in the type system. When this relationship is violated, it means your code is requiring contradictory types for the same variable.
