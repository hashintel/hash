//! HIR to HIR(ANF) normalization transformation.
//!
//! This module implements the conversion from HIR (High-level Intermediate Representation) to
//! HIR(ANF) (Administrative Normal Form), a reduced form of the HIR that differentiates between
//! values and computations for optimization and code generation purposes.
//!
//! # Administrative Normal Form (ANF)
//!
//! ANF is a program representation where:
//! - **Values** are atomic expressions: places (variables with projections) and constants
//! - **Computations** are everything else that requires evaluation
//! - Function applications can only be performed with values as arguments
//!
//! # Design Decisions
//!
//! This implementation deviates from traditional ANF in several ways:
//!
//! ## Closure Handling
//!
//! Traditional ANF supports closures as values, but this would double our implementation
//! complexity. Since closures are essentially pointers to basic blocks, we handle them
//! as control flow constructs rather than values.
//!
//! ## Projection-Based Variables
//!
//! We use projections instead of simple variables to:
//! - Enable mutable assignments in the MIR lowering phase
//! - Reduce the number of `let` bindings required
//! - Provide better optimization opportunities
//!
//! This trades some deduplication opportunities for simpler implementation and better
//! downstream optimization potential.
//!
//! # Boundaries
//!
//! We define boundaries where `let` bindings are accumulated:
//! - Closure definitions
//! - Branching constructs (control flow)
//! - Short-circuiting operations (`&&`, `||`)
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```text
//! // Before normalization:
//! foo(bar(x), baz(y))
//!
//! // After normalization:
//! let %1 = bar(x);
//! let %2 = baz(y);
//! foo(%1, %2)
//! ```
