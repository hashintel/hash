//! Graph hoisting optimization for HIR expressions.
//!
//! This module implements an optimization that moves (`hoists`) let bindings from within
//! graph read operations and closures to outer scopes when safe to do so. Graph reads
//! act as iterators, akin to `for` loops, so moving out loop-invariant expressions
//! reduces redundant computation.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```text
//! // Before hoisting:
//! graph.read(|entity| {
//!   let expensive = heavy_computation();  // Loop invariant - computed every iteration
//!   let dependent = expensive + entity.value;
//!   dependent
//! })
//!
//! // After hoisting:
//! let expensive = heavy_computation();    // Hoisted outside - computed once
//! graph.read(|entity| {
//!   let dependent = expensive + entity.value;
//!   dependent
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! The hoisting process preserves HIR(ANF) invariants by:
//!
//! 1. **Tracking scope boundaries**: Identifying when we're inside graph reads and closures
//! 2. **Dependency analysis**: For each binding, determining which variables it depends on
//! 3. **Safety checking**: Only hoisting bindings that don't depend on closure parameters
//! 4. **Dependency propagation**: Using an "infection" model where dependent bindings mark their
//!    outputs as scope-dependent, preventing further hoisting chains
//!
//! # Design Decisions
//!
//! **Let binding boundaries**: HIR(ANF) collapses lets where possible, making them natural
//! collection points for hoisting decisions without complex boundary detection. Graph reads and
//! closures are also (unlike traditional ANF) atoms, therefore can only happen inside of let
//! bindings.
//!
//! **Graph-nested scope restriction**: We only hoist inside closures nested within graph
//! operations, where the optimization provides maximum benefit while limiting analysis complexity.
//!
//! **Dependency propagation over union-find**: Instead of traditional union-find structures,
//! we use "dependency infection" where any binding depending on closure parameters marks
//! its output variable as scope-dependent. This preserves more hoisting opportunities than
//! union-find, which would aggressively union any variables referenced together.
