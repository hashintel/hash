/// The different kinds of nodes available in the HashQL High-Level Intermediate Representation.
///
/// This enum defines all the various node types that can appear in the HIR of a HashQL program.
/// While the AST closely mirrors the syntax of the source code, the HIR represents a more
/// semantically meaningful structure after resolving special forms, desugaring, and normalization.
///
/// The node kinds are organized into logical categories:
/// - Data nodes represent literal values and structured data
/// - Variable and binding nodes handle named values and scoping
/// - Operation nodes represent computations and type operations
/// - Control flow nodes manage execution paths and closures
/// - High-level nodes represent domain-specific constructs like graph operations
///
/// Each variant contains a specific node structure that provides the detailed
/// representation of that construct in the HIR.
