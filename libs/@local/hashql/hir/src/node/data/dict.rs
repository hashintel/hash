/// Key differences between dictionaries and structs in HashQL:
/// - Dictionary keys are expressions evaluated at runtime; struct fields are identifiers known at
///   compile time.
/// - Dictionary values must all be of the same type; struct fields can have different types.
/// - Dictionaries allow adding and removing entries dynamically; structs have a fixed set of
///   fields.
/// - Dictionary keys can be computed or derived from variables; struct fields are statically named.
/// - Dictionary access requires runtime resolution; struct field access is resolved at compile
///   time.
