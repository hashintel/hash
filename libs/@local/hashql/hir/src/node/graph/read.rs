//! Graph read operations in the HashQL HIR.
//!
//! This module defines the structure for graph read operations, which are used to query and
//! retrieve data from the bi-temporal graph database. A graph read operation consists of three main
//! components:
//!
//! - **Head**: Determines the starting point of the query.
//! - **Body**: Contains filtering operations to narrow down results.
//! - **Tail**: Specifies how to finalize the query.
