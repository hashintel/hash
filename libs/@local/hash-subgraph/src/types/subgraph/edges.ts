 * This provides a sanity check that we've almost correctly expressed `Edges` as a subtype of the Block Protocol one.
 *
 * We unfortunately need these two different types because in the Block Protocol we had to use `|` instead of `&` due
 * to overlapping index types. We _wanted_ to use `&` but it produces unsatisfiable types. However, because we have
 * branded types here (thus the index types do not overlap) we can do better in HASH and use `&`, although this confuses
 * TypeScript and it thinks they are incompatible. Thus, the strange check type.
