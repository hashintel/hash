//! Ontology provenance module that contains types for tracking ownership and history
//!
//! This module provides types for managing the ownership and provenance of ontology types
//! within the Block Protocol Type System. It defines structures for:
//!
//! 1. Tracking ownership of ontology types (locally owned vs remotely fetched)
//! 2. Recording provenance information about type creation and modifications
//! 3. Managing edition-specific provenance with creator and archiver information
//!
//! These types enable complete tracking of type history and support governance of
//! the ontology across distributed systems.
