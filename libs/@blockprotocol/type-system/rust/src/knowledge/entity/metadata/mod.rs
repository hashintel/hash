//! Entity metadata that includes identity, provenance, type information, and temporal data.

//! This module provides types for tracking comprehensive metadata about an entity in the knowledge

//! - Record identification
//! - Temporal versioning
//! - Type information
//! - Archival status
//! - Provenance tracking
//! - Confidence indicators
//! - Property-specific metadata
