# Block Protocol Type System

An in-development package that provides Rust typings and implementations for the Block Protocol Type-System. See the [RFC](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/rfcs/text/0352-graph-type-system.md) for more details

The corresponding TypeScript implementation can be found in the [`@blockprotocol/type-system`](../typescript) package. This crate is used to generate the TypeScript typings from the Rust implementation.
