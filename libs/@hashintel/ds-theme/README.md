# @hashintel/ds-theme

A Panda CSS preset for HASH's design system, providing a consistent and reusable set of design tokens and styles for building user interfaces.

This is used by `@hashintel/ds-components` and apps that use this design system.

## About Token Sources

`src/main.ts` contains the PandaCSS preset definition. This depends on values in `src/theme`, which are generated by token scripts. Primary color palettes are generated from Radix colors (`scripts/generate-colors-radix.ts`). The legacy Figma export (`scripts/figma-variables.json` via the [Luckino](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1495722115809572711) plugin) is still used for non-color tokens and will be retired after the next token refresh.
