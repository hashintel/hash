# @hashintel/ui-preset

A Panda CSS preset for HashIntel's design system, providing a consistent and reusable set of design tokens and styles for building user interfaces.

This is used by `@hashintel/styled-system`, which in turn is used by `@hashintel/component-library` and apps that use this design system.
