# Petrinaut

A component for editing [**Petri nets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net), and progressive support for [**SDCPN**](Stochastic Deterministic Coloured Petri Nets).

Currently **under development** and not ready for usage.

## Development Mode

For development and testing, you can use the included dev mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start a development server with a fully functional Petrinaut editor that uses local storage to persist created nets.
