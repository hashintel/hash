/// [`BrightColor`] counterpart, `232` - `255` are a grayscale from black to white while all others

///
/// ## Support
///
/// Nowadays every modern terminal emulator supports xterm colors, this can be easily checked by
/// executing `echo $TERM`, if the name is prefixed with `xterm-` the terminal is likely able to
/// support these colors, the dedicated crate [`supports-color`](https://lib.rs/crates/supports-color)
/// can be used to detect this (and many other) indicators for xterm color scheme support.
///
/// ## History
///
/// The name xterm color comes from the xterm terminal, the standard terminal emulator that is
/// shipped with the [X Window System]. Since 1999, support for a new color mode was added that
/// brought 256 colors, instead of the previously available 16 colors to the terminal.
///
/// ## Specification
///
/// The format for the escape sequence was first added in 1994 via [ISO 8613-6], which states in
/// chapter 40:
///
/// > If the first parameter element has the value 5, then there is a second parameter element
/// > specifying the index into the colour table given by the attribute
/// > "content colour table" applying to the object with which the content is associated.
///
/// [ISO 8613-6] and [ECMA-48] specified the separator between elements to be `03/10` (`:`), until
/// [ISO 8613-6] was rediscovered in the early 2010s implementations used the format initially used
/// by `xterm`, which used `;` as a separator instead of `:`. Most actively maintained open-source
/// terminal emulators like [xterm], [kitty] or [wezterm] support both delimiter and recommend
/// the use of `:`. Note that most built-in terminal emulators like [`Terminal.app`] do **not**
/// support `;` as a delimiter.
/// A detailed explanation as to why this discrepancy between standard and implementation
/// happened can be read in the [xterm repository](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/xterm-snapshots/blob/8d625aa49d5fdaa055a9f26d514121f032c7b771/charproc.c#L1957-L2028).

///

/// support RGB colors, this support is often not very well documented, but one can often use the
/// `COLORTERM` environment variable to inspect if truecolor is supported. (the value of the
/// variable will be `truecolor`). Most built-terminals, do **not** support true-color by default.
/// To programmatically check for support it is advised to use a crate similar to [`supports-color`](https://lib.rs/crates/supports-color)
///
/// ## Specification
///
/// [ISO 8613-6] standardized the additional escape codes `38` (foreground) and `48` (background) in
/// 1994 for extended color support. These escape codes follow a specific format, where one can
/// specify additional parameters to influence the color used. These parameters are separated by
/// `:` and trailing optional parameters can be omitted.
///
/// The first parameter is always the color mode, which can either be:
///
/// * 0: implementation defined
/// * 1: [`TransparentColor`]
/// * 2: [`RgbColor`]
/// * 3: [`CmyColor`]
/// * 4: [`CmykColor`]
/// * 5: [`IndexedColor`]
///
/// The parameters required afterwards are dependent on the color mode specified, [`IndexedColor`]
/// only allows a single parameter (the index), for more information visit the related
/// documentation. [`TransparentColor`] does not support any additional parameters while
/// [`RgbColor`], [`CmyColor`], [`CmykColor`] support 7 (8 in the case of [`CmykColor`]) additional
/// parameters.
///
/// The format for these true-colors can be distilled into:
///
/// `{color space id}:{color components}:{tolerance value}:{color space of the tolerance value}`
///
/// Where `color space id`, `tolerance value` and `color space of tolerance value` are considered
/// optional and are left unspecified by the standard. Most terminal emulators that support these
/// either ignore any value set or do only support a legacy format.
///
/// The color components are separated by `:`, for [`RgbColor`] they are `{r}:{g}:{b}`, for
/// [`CmyColor`] they are `{c},{m},{y}`, for [`CmykColor`] they are `{c},{m},{y},{k}`, e.g.
/// `ESC[38:2::{r}:{g}:{b}m`.
///
/// ### Legacy Format
///
/// true-color support was first introduced in [xterm], which supported a reduced set using `;`
/// instead of `:` as a parameter separator, only supporting [`RgbColor`] and **not** supporting any
/// optional fields. This format is known through `antsi` as legacy format. If built-in terminals
/// (like [Terminal.app]) support [`RgbColor`], they often do through the legacy format (e.g.
/// `ESC[38;2;{r};{g};{b}m`), modern terminal emulator like [kitty], [wezterm], [mintty] support the
/// legacy format, but advice the use of the official format instead.
// TODO: To switch `antsi` to the
// legacy format use [`Style::set_compliance`] and [`Style::set_delimiter`].
///
/// For a detailed explanation as to why the alternative format was introduced please refer to the
/// reasoning in the [xterm repository].
