# HASH Development Guide

## Repository Structure and Navigation

The HASH repository is organized into several key directories:

- `/apps` - Core applications powering HASH
  - `/hash-api` - Backend API service
  - `/hash-frontend` - Web frontend application
  - `/hash-graph` - Graph database service
  - `/hash-external-services` - External service integrations
  - `/hash-ai-worker-ts` - AI worker services
  - `/hash-integration-worker` - Integration worker services

- `/blocks` - Block Protocol components (each subfolder contains a self-contained block)

- `/libs` - Shared libraries and packages
  - `/@blockprotocol` - Block Protocol related libraries
  - `/@hashintel` - HASH-specific libraries
  - `/@local` - Internal libraries for the monorepo
  - Other core libraries (e.g., `error-stack`)

- `/infra` - Deployment and infrastructure code
  - `/docker` - Docker configurations
  - `/terraform` - Terraform infrastructure as code

- `/tests` - Test suites spanning multiple components

**Navigation Tips:**

- When exploring a new feature, first identify which app or lib it belongs to
- Related code is typically co-located within the same directory
- Check existing implementations before creating new ones
- For understanding cross-component interactions, look for integration tests in `/tests`

## Common Commands

### Development

- Main development: `yarn dev` (starts API and frontend)
- Backend only: `yarn dev:backend` or `yarn dev:backend:api`
- Frontend only: `yarn dev:frontend`

### Starting Services

- Start all services: `yarn start`
- Start graph only: `yarn start:graph`
- Start backend only: `yarn start:backend`
- Start frontend only: `yarn start:frontend`
- Start workers: `yarn start:worker`

### Testing

- Unit tests: `yarn test:unit`
- Integration tests: `yarn test:integration`

### Linting and Fixing

- Lint everything: `yarn lint`
- TypeScript type check: `yarn lint:tsc`
- ESLint: `yarn lint:eslint`
- Formatting check: `yarn lint:format`

- Fix ESLint issues: `yarn fix:eslint`
- Fix formatting: `yarn fix:format`

### For Specific Packages

When working on a specific package, use:

```bash
# For TypeScript/JavaScript packages
turbo run <command> --filter '<package-name>'

# For Rust packages
cargo nextest run --package <package-name>
cargo test --package <package-name> --doc  # For doc tests
cargo clippy --all-features --package <package-name>
```

For Rust packages, you can add features as needed with `--all-features`, specific features like `--features=foo,bar`, or use `cargo-hack` with `--feature-powerset` for comprehensive feature testing.
