# Bastion hosts

The Bastion hosts defined through this configuration is used for SSH-ing into the private subnet of our AWS VPC. Bastion hosts are spun up per environment (e.g. `prod` and `dev`) and connect using current terraform outputs.

It is possible to SSH into the Bastion host by running the `./ssh_bastion.sh` script. This script will use the currently selected terraform workspace to SSH into the appropriate host.

The Bastion host can also act as a jump host to SSH tunnel a service to your local machine. For example to forward the RDS instance in the private subnet to your local machine, run

```shell
./ssh_bastion.sh -L 5554:h-hash-prod-usea1-pg.*.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432
```

This will SSH into the bastion host, but also bind `localhost:5554` to `h-hash-prod-usea1-pg.*.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432` on the remote host.
